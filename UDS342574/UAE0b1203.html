<P>the future, and the sooner one finds that peace of mind which  is not common even amongst the young,<br>and should be light hearted in these, or words to this effect, my dear mother prepared us for our first<br>plunge into society, we discussed the little good habits we were to maintain, and, amongst others,<br>certain little customs for we were to be away for a week, we cant take all our good habits with<br>us, if you wont come, i said, what is to become of the sunday readings for my mother used to read to<br>us every sunday evening, and we were just in the middle of that book of wondrous fascination. the<br>pilgrims progress, if it were not for the others and of you would treat us with it, said fatima<br>thoughtfully, we might take the book with us, and many might read to me, if she would i like her<br>reading, my mother consented, there was another copy in the house, and though this volume was a<br>favourite, she said it was time we learnt to take care of valuable books, so it was settled, we talked no<br>more that evening; and the clouds drifted out of sight, they have gone to bed in a big dark cloud on<br>the other side said fatima,yawning; and we went to bed also, my story wonders, idp; this is because it<br>is an old womans tale, old people of my age become prosy, my dear, they love to linger over little<br>rememberences of youth, and to recall the good counsels of kindvoices long silent, but i must not put<br>you to sleep a second time, so i will not describe lists of good habits which fatima and i drew up in<br>widened, till there seems no bridging the gap between christians and christian, between churchman and<br>churchman all being members of one catholic church but it was not so in the days of antony dalaber<br>the thought of split and schism was pain and grief to most. luther had foreseen it, was working for it,<br>and the leaven of his teaching was permeating this and other lands; but it had taken no great hold as<br>yet, the church was revered and venerated of her children, and here in england the abuses rampant in<br>so many lands were far less fragrant, england had been kept from much evil bt her inherent distant of<br>papal supremacy, the notion had more or less combated it in all countries. romes headdship only<br>received a qualified assent, soverigns and people had alike resented the too great exercise of the papal<br>prerogative; and this had done much for the church in england. it seemed as though a very little would<br>be enough to serve the purpose of these early reformers, and in the main they hold the doctrines<br>taught, and were willing and ready to obey most of the churchs injunctions, a man like anthony<br>dalaber, versatile and eager, easily roused to enthusiasm and passionate revolt, but as easily soothed<br>by gentleness and kindly argument of a truly catholic kind, was not a little preplexed in such a <br>situation as he now found himself if seemed to him that he would be in a far more false position as is<br>branded heretic, debarred from the communion of the church, than as a faithful son, undergoing some <br>penonce and discipline at her hands, he spent many long and painful hours writing out his confession,<br>seeking to make plain the condition of his mind, and proving to his own satisfaction that he was no<br>heretic, he only claimed that men might have liberty to read for themselves, in their own tongue the<br>surprised to find it there  ehy, nothing nothing. i often take a notion to to look at it like this. then face went crimson, you've heard the news, i see, he tried to hide the bitterness behind the word, but<br>one lip corner switched and quivered, they pooled you in advance, did they, but you did not believe it i was<br>as bad as that, did you you didnt think, did you, sleve, that id go out leaving you to blame yourself<br>even a little bit his question was curiously wistful wistful and as unsteady as the hand which now<br>proferred that blunt borreled, huge bore gun, here you take it, if if youll sleep the sounder, and dont<br>you worry over me, i ll see you in the morning, sleeve, a girl like her save for a short and casual see<br>you in the morning, garry, stephen, amare burned without a word that night and left the improvised<br>sleeping quarters in the storehouse shock, it was a mans leave taking, short to abruptness, on badly<br>stereotyped that it denied utterly very conciousness of threatened, reckless tragedy and cordially<br>intimate only because in all man to man speech there is less and less of actual sincereity in a<br>multiplicity of words, but he might have talked till daylight and still have failed to register the<br>binding acceptance of garryes promis, which is silence, unaided, achieved, soundlessly, unemotionally,<br>sleve closed the door on that figure on the bank edge which, suddenly slack of limb and shoulder,had</P>
