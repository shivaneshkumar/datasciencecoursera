<P>which seemed to let in a seperate blast for every hair of ones fur. i followed the cook, it is true; but i<br>did not follow the cook as a rule not, for instance, when she went out to the coal hole in the yard. i <br>had slipped in under her dress. i was behind the potato tub when she went out, shutting the door after<br>her. for some mysterious reason i felt on the tip claw of expectation. my nose twitched with agreeable<br>sensations. an inward voice seemed to murmur, loots regardless of the draughts, i sprang on to the<br>shelf close under the window and there was such a dish of cream the saucers in which one got it at<br>breakfast did not hold a twentieth part of what this brimming pan contained. as to the five oclock<br>china, in which visitors give you a tepid teaspoonful, with bits of old tea leaves in it i grinned at the<br>thought as i drew in toungeful after toungeful of the thick yellow cream. at this moment i heard my<br>young mistress voice in the distant passages. tools, tools she miowed on, for she wasnt much quicker witted than<br>the rest of her race. no, thank you, thought i; and if you want five oclock loots for yourself|, i advise<br>you to come here for it. i thought this, but speak i really could not i was too busy lapping. it was<br>delicious stuff but when the dish was about three parts empty, i began to feel as if i had had a good<br>deal, and to wish i had more appetite for the rest. its a shame to leave it, though, i thought, when a<br>few more laps will empty the dish. for i came of an ancient and rough tounged cat family, who always<br>lick their platters clean. so i set to work again, though the draught was most annoying, and froze the<br>could stand it no longer but dropped invisible behind the breastwork. but the climax of the whole was<br>as the cleveland man says when mrs. peck went out in the middle of the service. it was, however, the<br>means of reconciling the whole society; for after that first day we heard no more opposition to the<br>warm stove in the meeting house. with all this corroborative evidence i think it is fully proved that the<br>event really happened in litchfield, and that the honor was stolen for other towns by unveracious<br>chronicles; otherwise we must believe in an amazing unanimity of church joking and sham fainting all<br>over new england. the very nature, the stern, pleasure hating and trial glorying purilan nature, which<br>made our forefathers leave their english homes to come, for the love of god and freedom of<br>conscience, to these wild, barren, and unwelcoming shores, made them also endure with fortitude and<br>almost with satisfaction all personal discomforts, and caused them to cling with persistent firmness to<br>such outward symbols of austere contempt of luxury, and such narrow minded signs of love of<br>simplicity as the lack of comfortable warmth during the time of public worship. the religion which they<br>had endured such bitter hardships to establish, did not, in their minds, need any shielding and coddling<br>to keep it alive, but thrived for better on spartan severity and simplicity; hence it took two centuries<br>of gradual and most lardy softening and modifying of character to prepare the puritan mind for so<br>advanced a reform and luxury as proper warmth in the meeting houses in winter. ix. the noon house.<br>there might have been seen a hundred years ago, by the side of many an old meeting house in new<br>ammunition yonder at the top of the trap. yes, said the doctor; i begin tot hink youre right about<br>that, griggs. and seeking what a stand the poor people made here, fighting from room to room or house<br>to house, i suppose i ought to call it i cant help thinking that there was something pretty desperate<br>went on before they let the enemy get up those steps. no doubt, said the doctor, and that accounts for<br>so many of the stones of that breastwork being missing. thats right, sir. well, i want to go down into<br>that hole with a big light, and see whats at the bottom there. im reckoning that we could find out<br>what kind of weapons the enemy had to fight against the stones. yes, cried ned; their swords and well.<br>i dont know about swords, squire, said the american dryly, but they must have had something to fight<br>with. i vote that we go and see. this was agreed to without hesitation on the doctors part, and the<br>party made their way back to the top of the steps. there was a pause here while all walked along the<br>four sides, where hundreds of stones averaging the size of a mans head lay jus as they had been<br>placed ages before; and then the descent was made to the opening at the side where the heap of dust<br>had disappeared, and a short consultation took place. youll have to give up for to day, griggs, said<br></P>
