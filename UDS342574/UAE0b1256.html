<P>naturally form a cruel and and vindictive character. such these inlanders seemed to us on our first visiting<br>them. the sight of beings so extraordinary for thus we europeans must have appeared to them excited<br>in their savage minds the greatest wonder; and they thought we were sent as a scourge and an enemy;<br>and though cook, one of their earliest visitors, abopted every method his ingenuity could devise to<br>conciliate them, yet, as they never could throughly understand his intentions, they were always on the<br alert to attack him. hence arose the horror and disgust expressed formerly at the mere mention of the<br>name of a mew zealander. i have often tried, in vain, to account for there being such a decided<br>dissimilarity between the natives of new holland and newzealand so trifling is the difference in their<br>situation on the globe, and so similar their climates both having remained so long unknown to the<br>great continents, and so devoid of intercourse wiith the rest of ther world that ine would be led to<br >imagine a great esemblance must be the result. but the natives of the former seem of the lowest grade<br>the last link in the great chain of existence which unites man with the monkey. their limbs are long,<br>thin, and flat, eith large bony knees and elbows, a projecting forehead, and pot belly, the mind, too,<br>seems adopted to this mean configuration; they have neither energy, enterprise, nor industry; and their<br>curiosity can scarcely be excited a few exceptions may be met with; but these are their general<br>characteristics. while the natives of the latter island are cast in beautys perfect mould; the children are<br>bones. see how that all crumbled away when my father picked it up. dust and ashes, we ought to call<br>it. do you want to go back n no, i think not i say, what a fight it must have been yes, said chris,<br>with a deep breath that sounded like a sigh. one seems to fancy one can see the men who had the<br>white skulls being driven back from this cell into that one, and i shouldnt wonder if we find that yes,<br>came the doctors voice from the next place, its wonderfully interesting. the civilised men must have been<br>making a desperate stand here, and i fully expect that we shall find that they were driven back from<br>cell to cell. yes, he said, with his voice growing fainter, what do you say, griggs its worse in here, air,<br>and yes, worse still in the next place. diven back from cell to cell, cried the doctor, and its my<br>impression that we shall find the remains of women and children in the farthest one. we shall hit upon<br>the scene of a terrible massacre the destrution of the race who built up this place. the boys had joined<br>the speakers now, just in time to hear wilton speak but i say lee, arent you letting your imagination<br>carry you a little too far i think not, replied the doctor quietly. look here; you cannot call this<br>imagination. small as the space is in these rock chambers, there are the remains of scores of men who<br>fought desperately for their lives, to me it seems like a vivid reproduction of the past. how far back<br>said bourne. ah, that is beyond me. how long would it takes these bones to decay to this extent as they<br>lay here just as their owners fell it is a question that no man can answer one dependent upon the<br>action of the air in a climate like this, with the remains sheltered from sun and rain, to gradually pass<br>away into dust. you can see plainly enough that these are not the remains found in some burial place,<br>is after ten; i begin to suspect we must alter our course, and defer a view of the east to a more<br>favourable oppurtunitym and particularly as we are likely to have an accompaniment of water. never<br>mind, said merrywell, we can very soon be in very comfortable quarters; besides a rattler is always to<br>be had or a comfortable lodging to be procured with an obliging bed fellow dont you begin to croak<br>before there is any occasion for it what has time to do with us aye aye, said franky harry, dont be after<br>damping us before we get wet; this is the land of plenty, and there is no fear of being lost come along.<br>on the opposite side, said tom, addressing his cousin, is the bank of england; it is a building of large<br>extent and immense business; you can now only discern its exterior by the light of the lamps; it is<br>however a place to which we must pay a visit, and take a complete survey upon some future occasion.<br>in the front is the royal exchange, the daily resort of the merchants and traders of the metropolis, to<br>transact their various business come, said merry well, i find we are all upon the right scent frank<br>harry has promised to introduce us to a house of well known resort in this neighbourhood we will<br>shelter ourselves under the staple commodity of the country for the woolsack and the wool pack, i<br></P>
