<P>thousands pieces of eight in ready cash, all which he wasted in that little time, and became as poor as i<br>have told you. but to return brasiliano, after having spent all, was forced to go to sea again to seek<br>his fortune he set forth towards the coast of campechy, his common rendezvous: fifteen days after his<br>arrival, he pat himself into a canoe to espy the port of that city, and see if he could rob any spanish<br>vessel; but his fortune was so bad, that both he and all his men were taken and carried befor the<br>governor, who immediately cast them into a dungeon, intending to hang them every one; and doubtless<br>he had done so, but for a stratagem of barsiliano, which saved their lives. he wrote a letter to the<br>governor, in the names of other pirates that were abroad at sea, telling them he should have a care<br>how he used those persons he had in custody; for if he hurt them in the least, they swore they would<br>never give quarter to any spaniard that should fall into their hands. these pirates having been often at<br>campechy, and other places of the west indies in the spanish dominions, the governor feared what<br>mischief their conypanions abroad might do, if he should punish them. hereupon he released them,<br>exacting only an oath on them that they would leave their exercise of piracy for ever; and withal he<br>sent them as common mariners, in the galleons, to spain. they got in this voyage, all together, five<br>hundred pieces of eight; so that they tarried not long there after their arrival. providing themselves<br>with necessaries, they returned to jamaica, from whence they set forth again to sea, committing greater<br>i do and youve known it for longer, saif they were silent for a while. and then said, so you think the<br>man was not cheated, do you shouldnt pay too much attention to peoples opinions. the text cannot be altered<br>and the various opinions are often no more than an expression of despair over it. theres even one<br>opinion which says its the doorkeeper has been cheated. that does seem to take things  too far, said<br>how can they argue the doorkeeper has been cheated their argument, answered the priest, is bassd on<br>the simplicity of the doorkeeper. they say the doorkeeper doesnt know the inside of the law, only the<br>way in to it where he just walks up and down. they see his ideas of whats inside the law as rather<br>childish, and suppose hes afraid himself of what he wants to make the mae frightened of yes, hes<br>more afraid of it than the man, as the man wants nothing but to go inside the law, even after hes<br>heard about the terrible doormen there, in contrast to the doorkeeper who doesnt want to go in, or at<br>least we dont hear anything about it. on the other hand, there are those who say he must have already<br>been inside the law as he has been taken on into its service and that could only have been done inside.<br>that can be countered by supposing he could have been given the job of doorkeeper by somebody<br>calling out from inside, and that he cant have gone very far inside as he couldnt bear the sight of the<br>given, nor a bray such as his father would have uttered, but a hoarse yell made up of the most<br>discordant elements of both, and it was no wonder that the doctors voice was drowned. be quiet, you<br>brute he cried angrily, making a pretence of kicking it in the pack; and then he stared in wonder, for<br>it seemed as if a fresh misfortune had affected one member of the expedition in a peculiar way. that<br>member was chris, who suddenly dropped his hold of skeeters rein, and with his face horribly distorted,<br>began to roll about it in his saddle. oh, griggs he gasped. ned somebody hold me on. what is it, boy<br>cried the doctor bitten n n n n no, farher, he panted and then, oh dear oh dear i i i i i cant help it. i<br>there were other words, but they were confused and strange; but though they did not convey in words<br>the meaning of the seizure, they pointed out what was the matter. for it became evident that chris was<br>laughing wildly madly hysterically, and to such an extent that he had lost all control of himself, and<br>had hard work to keep in the saddle. to make matters worse, the mirth proved contagious to such an<br>extent that griggs sat looking at him, then at the males, and hack again, with his mouth expanding<br>into a broad grin, while ned slid off his mustang quietly, held on to the rein, and then lay down in the<br>sand, to laugh in the same uncontrolled fashion. well, cried bourne angrily, this is a nice way to treat<br>our misfortunes i i i cant help it, father, panted ned, and he laughed more than ever, while wiltons lips<br>as he sat looking on began to quiver and then widen out. here, stop it, you two, he growled at last.<br></P>
