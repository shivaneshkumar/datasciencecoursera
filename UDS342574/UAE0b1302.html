<P>ridden nearlyto death; now, theyll have a good rest with plenty of fine pasture. but about to morrow<br>griggs said chris. what about to morrow the indians may follow us and overtake us on foot. well, if<br>they do, they do, my lad, and at the very worst they may capture some of our stores. but perhaps not.<br>i dont like being a brute to a dumb beast, but if im driven to it i may have to be a bit hard to some<br>of those mules. they can go so fast that no indian can catch them if they like. yes well, as a rule they<br>dont like. thats the worst of it, said chris. yes, hut this time theyve got to like; and i knew how to<br>make them. daybreak at last, and with thatdawn all doubts about the mule convoy were at an end,<br>for the first streaks of dawn showed them about a mile ahead, truding steadily along, while no<br>brodening of the day, not even the rising of the sun, revealed that for which a most anxious lookout<br>was kept, namely, so many dark dots to indicate that the indians were on their trail. i say they wont<br>come now, said griggs decisively. well halt, sir, at the first water, and have a good rest and feed. will it<br>be safe said the doctor. we must chance that, sir, for the sake of making horse, mule, man and boy fit<br>for what more he has to do. well, perhaps so. it wont be losing time, and the mules and horses have<br>done a good spell of work. fifty four. onward. whether the indians followed up their trail the peril<br>finders never know, for they saw no more of that tribe, and wandered on for days in safety, passing<br>human inhabitants or civilizations: all appeared wild and magnificent as if just fresh from the hands of<br>nature; and it failed not to lead the mind up to the contemplation of the creator. it seemed utterly<br>impossible to reconcile the idea that such lonely, romantic, and sequestered scenes couuld conceal hordes<br>of savage cannibals, or that the tranquility of this very place would soon be exchanged for the noise<br>and tumult of savage warfare. we soon reached the village where the coalesced chiefs had taken up<br>their stations: they had fortified their position, and were waiting the approach of the enemy. no sooner,<br>however, was our arrival known, than all came running down tumultuosly to give us welcome: all<br>business was laid aside to greet our landing, and we were conducted with great ceremony into the centre<br>of the camp chapter xxxix. construction of a pa. we found eight hundred warriors, who to use a sea<br>phrase were all at quarters. the magic pen of scott might here have been well employed to describe the<br>gathering. the chiefs sat apart from their followers in deep consultation: we did not approach near<br>enough to hear their discussion; but it ended by their paying us a high compliment for coming<br>amongst them. the young and active were busily employed in constructing a strong stockade fort to<br>annoy the enemy as he approached; others were preparing their weapons, or practising the use of arms.<br>the village itself was an object of extreme interest; and after contemplating the war like preparations<br>each accused the other of being the cause of quarrel, and the consequent loss of the white men. this was preciselu the state of things we wished for; and, while we were waiting the return of the last boat,<br>a messenger came from the elder chiefs, to propose an amicable adjustment of the affair. the chiefs<br>promised that, if we would reland our goods and remain with them, the man we protected should go<br>without molestation on board the brig; but, if we persevered in leaving them, the man should be killed<br>before our eyes. this was what we expected; and though i really now wished to leave them, being quite<br>tried of these perpetual broils, we assented, in order that the mans life might be spared when they<br>found we agreed to their proposal, they retreated out of sight, thereby carefully avoiding polluting<br>their eyes by looking upon their enemy no sooner had they disappeared than i visited the poor fellow<br>who had been the cause of all this disturbance:he seemed half dead woith anxiety; but i soon revived<br>him with the information that all was settled amicably and we lost no time ingetting him off which<br>we safely accomplished, though as the boat which conveyed him left the shore, a bullet whizzed close<br>by me, aimed, no doubt, by some young fiery chief, who had concealed himself in the bushes for that<br>purpose. during this transaction i witnessed the natural kindness of heart and disinterested tenderness<br>of the female sex: no matter how distressing the circumstance or appaling the danger, they are, in all<br>countries, the last to forsake man. while the enraged chiefs were yelling outside our house, and all our<br>exertions could scarcely prevent them from making a forcible entry, all the women were sitting with,<br></P>
