<P>generally eat a good deal then, and i often laugh, for nurse and mrs. savary are so funny together<br>but mrs. savary very kind, and lost time she came she brought me a pincushion, and the time before <b>she gave me a spa mug and two apples mrs. overtheway laughed, too, at idas rambling account, and<br>the two were in high good humour. what shall i do to amuse you asked the little old lady, you couldnt<br>tell me another story said ida, with an accent that meant, i hope you can i would, gladly, my dear<br>but i dont know what to tell you about; and she looked round the room as if there were stories in the<br>furniture which perhaps there were, idas eyes followed her, and then she remembered the picture, and<br>said: oh would you please tell me what the writing means under that pretty little sketch the little old<br>lady smiled rather sadly, and looked at the sketch in silence for a few moments, then she said; it is<br>russian, my dear, their betters are different from ours, the words are reka dom and they mean river<br>house. ida gazed at the daring with increased interest. oh, do you remember anything about it if you<br>would tell me abort that she cried, but mrs. overtheway was silent again, she was looking down, and<br>twisting some of the little rings upon her hand, and ida felt ashamed of having asked, i beg your<br>pardon, she said, imploringly, i was very rude, mrs. overtheway; tell me what you like, please<br>you are a good child said a little old lady, a very good child, my dear, i do remember so much<br>about that house, that i fall into day dreams when i look at it, it brings back the memories of a great<br>such men as master garret, who arthur paused, for a curious smile had illumined d. higdons face, he<br>locked full at arthur as he said; yes, master garret, who arthur paused, for a curious smile had illumined dr. higdons face. he<br>locked full at arthur as he said; yes, master garret has been much to blame in this matter; but the<br>cardial has so dealt with him by gentleness and kindness, and by the dear and forceful reasoning of<br>which he is master, which thomas garret himself is now in oxford, ready to do penance for his sins<br>of disobedience and rebellion; and to this submission do we owe that of his confederates and lesser<br>brethen. when they heard that he had promised compliance to the cardinals commands, they themselves<br>yielded without much delay. garret here in oxford exclaimed arthur, in surprise, and a penitent, submissive to the cardinal then, truly, no others should be hard to persuade, but what is it that the<br>cardinals ask of them dr. higdon smiled that rather subtle smile which on many faces, and especially<br>on these ecclesiastics, tends to grow into one of craft. he talk it an act of recantation, but we speak<br>of it to the young men as one of obedience and reconciliation. there will be here in oxford a solemn <br>function like unto what was seen not more than a year ago in london, when those who have been<br>excommunicated, but are now about to be reconciled, will appear in procession, each carrying a fagot<br>for the fire which will be lighted at carfax; and having thrown their fagot, they will then throw upon<br>the flames some of those noxious books the poison of which has done such hurt to them and others;<br>and having thus humbled themselves to obedience, they will be received and reconciled, and on easter<br>day will be readmitted to the holy ordinances from which they have been excluded all these weeks, and<br>empty conceit, either he just did, some mens judgement was quicker, surer than others, that was all<br>and he played well last night, but he could not overcome with nerve what he had lacked in capital,<br>five cards and many dollars oft will beat a better hand, but his dollars had been few, so had the tested<br>again a time tried truth, and proved it, a man should not gamble at all; that is, not when he needs to<br>win. for then he was sure to lose, that was why they called luck a lady. clink your money in your<br>pocket and not care whether you won or lost, and shed fair swarm upon you, she wouldnt let you be<br>nothing was too good for you you were a king two deuces and a lazy smile would bluff a brace of aces<br>but just you let her guess, that your straits were desperate, just you let her guess that your last dollar<br>was on table you couldnt catch a pair back to back in forty seven years, shed quit you flat that<br>was why they called luck a lady. just like a woman and he had lost less composedly than they had suspected from his face and comment, he had gone, then, still early, to bed to escape their torment, it<br>was not often that they had found him  so completely at their mercy, and they made the most of it, and<br>had risen and ridden out at dawn toward reservoir, reservoir would offer nothing; but it was on the road<br>he menat to travel, and water was to be had there, he rode early because he did not chose that any </P>
