he could<br>not summon back that serene self surety ehich, toward the end, had shaken even the girl, certainity in<br>herself, be could no longer argue convincingly with a vision of her, as be bad often argued with<br>barbara herself, that his way would be her way in the end. jor he had begun to realize the width of<br>that gulf which be knew must seem to exist between them, if not to her then to the eyes, of others of<br>her world. it was, his, memories, which gave him consolation those fang nights, bit they also gave him<br>doubt, remembering ifre dainliness of irer as, she had come to him, the night of irer party, recalling the<br>things, to which she had been accustomed since she had opened her eyes, on the first light of day, he<br>bega to ask himself as every man like him has, asked who ever loved a woman, how in any fairness<br>be coald expect her to accept the little which be could offer in return, to steve and fat joe, to the men<br>of his gang, his confidence was that of the old, old steve who, ten years before, had cocked his, head at<br>one of allisons, switch engines and promised gravely, ill bev to be gittin one of them for myself, some<br>day but his, heart ached, and when that ache became so leaden that be couldnt endure it any longer in<br>very handsome and good, and i knew, if i pat him in the middle, be would let anything sit upon him.<br>he would not feel it, or mind if be did. he takes, no notice of cocky, benjamin never quarrek, with cocky,<br>hut he dare not forget that cocky is there, and cocky sometimes looks at benjamins yellow eyes as, if it<br>were thinking bow very easily they would come out. but they are quite sufficiently happy together for<br>a happy family. the mice gave more trouble than all the rest, so i settled that lettice should wind up,<br>the mechanical mouse, and run that on as the curtain rose, iimemor esto majorum. old motto. all my<br>fears are laid aside, if i hut remember only such as these have lived and died longfellow. do you wish to<br>avoid vexations, then never have a happy family mine were countless, fred could not get me an owl.<br>lettice did want to show off with cocky, i had my own way, but she looked sulky and spiteful, i got<br>tom smiths, magpie; bat to have him, too however, my costume as showman was gorgeous, and<br>edward kept our happy family well together, we arranged that tom should put may on at the left wing,<br>and then run round behind, behind, and call mag softly from the right, then she would hop across the stage to<br>him, and snow off well. lettice was to let mother know when the spectators, might take their places, and<br>to tell the gardener when to raise the curtain, i really think one magpie must be a sign of sorrow, as<br>nurse says; but what made bernard take it into his, beautiful foolish head to give trouble i cannot<br>imagine. be wouldnt lie down, and when be did, it was with a grump of protest that seemed to forbode<br>failure, however, he let cocky scold him and pull his, hair, which was, a safety valve for cocky, benjamin<br>came hastily forward, and seeing who it was, uttered or exclamation of dismay. wolfe opened his, dim<br>eyes, be sw, julians face, but all the rest was, blotted out in a haze, lay me down, be said faintly; i<br>want nothing, the surgeons are here, said julians face,but all the rest was, blotted out in a haze, lay me down, be said faintly; i <br>want nothing, the surgeons are here, said julian anxiously as they put him out of the bot rays, of the<br>sun, which was now, shinning over heights, and plains, they can do nothing for me, said wolfe, in the<br>same faint, dreamy way; let them look to those whom they can help, a death like faintness was<br>creeping over him. the surgeon put a stimulating draught to his, lips; and wben a part had been<br>swalloed, proceeded to make a partial examination of the injuries sustained, but when he had opened<br>the breast of his, coat and saw two orifices in the neighbourhood of the heart, be shook his. head, and<br>laid the wounded man down to rest, julian felt a spasm of pain shoot through his, heart, like a thrust<br>from a bayonet, can you do nothing be asked in a whisper, nothing, was. the reply, be has, not an<br>hour to live, to be cut off in the very hour of victory exclaimed bumphery, with a burst of sorrow. it is<br>too hard too hard yet it is what he desired for bimself, said julian, in a low voice, i think it is what he<br>himself would have chosen, be has, suffered more than any of us, can well imagine, said the surgeon<br>gravely, we can scarcely grudge to him the rest and peace of the long, last sleep, bumphery turned<br>way to dash the tears from his eyes, in his, silent, dog like fashion, he had loved their young general<br></P>
