<P>spanish dominions in the west indies. here are huge quantities of pigeons at certain seasons. it is<br>watered by for rivulets, whereof two are always dry in summer. here is no trade or commerce bt the inhabitants;<br>neither do they plant more fruits than what are necessary for human life, though<br>the country would make very good plantations of tobacco of considerable profit, were it cultivated. as<br>soon as captain would make very good plantations of tobacco of considerable profit, were it cultivated. as<br>soon as captain morgan came near the island with his fleet, he sent one of his best sailing vessels to<br>view the entry of the river, and see if any other ships were there, who might hinder him from landing;<br>as also fearing lest they should give intelligence of his arrival to the inhabitants, and prevent his<br>designs. next day, before sunrise, all the fleet anchored near the island, in a bay called aguade granade.<br>on this bay the spaniards had built a battery, mounted with four pieces of cannon. captain morgan<br>landed about one thousand men in divers squadrons, marching through the woods, though they had no<br>other guides than a few of his own men, who had been there before, under mansvelt, the same day they<br>came to a place where the governor sometimes resided: here they found a battery called the platform, but nobody in it, the spaniards having retired to the lesser island, which, as was said before, is so near<br>the great one, that a short bridge only may conjoin them. this lesser island was so well fortified with<br>forts and batteries round it, as might seem impregnable. hereupon, as soon as the spaniards perceived<br>the pirates approach, they fired on them so furiously, that they could advance nothing that day, but<br>medical advice and prescriptions of roots and yarbs for their rheumatiz, neuralgy, and tissick; and<br>some took snuff together, while an ancient dame smoked a quiet pipe, and perhaps since they were<br>women as well as puritans they glanced with envy, admiration, or disapproval, or at any rate with<br>close scrutiny, at one anothers gowns and bonnets and cloaks, which the high walled pews within the<br>meeting house had carefully concealed from any inquistve, neighborly view the wood for these<br>beneficient noon house fires was given by the farmers of the congregation, a load by each well to do<br>land owner, if it were a society house, and occasionally an apple growing farmer gave a barrel of cyder<br>to supply internal instead of external warmth. cider sold in for six shillings old tenor a barrel, so it<br>was worth about the same as the wood both in money value and calorific qualities. a hundred years<br>previously in cider was worth ten shillings a barrel in, when first made in america, it was a costly<br>luxury, selling for s. a barrel that this thawed out sunday barrel of cider would prove invariably a<br>source of such refreshment, inspiration, solace, tounge loosing, and blood warming to the chilled and<br>shivering decons, elders, and farmers who gathered in the noon house, any one who has imbibed that<br>all potent and intoxication beverage, oft frozen hard cider, can fervently testify. sometimes a very<br>opulent farmer having built a noon house for his own and his familys exclusive use, would keep in it<br>as part of his duds a few, simple cooking utensils in which his wife or daughters would re heat or<br>one word, and everybody anslung his double piece. the mules, said the doctor then we must not have<br>them bitten, theyll be pretty safe where they are grazing, said griggs coolly. rattlesnakes dont care for<br>places like that. its in the stony sandy bits where they can get the full heat of the sun that there is<br>most risk. yes., said the doctor thoughtfully; perhaps we might leave them as they are. pick our<br>way slowly and carefully, doctor. shall i go first i dont like setting you always where there is most<br>danger, replied the doctor. none for me here, replied griggs. its my pooe mustang who has to run the<br>risk; bit ill try and save him all i can, how well, ive a sort of idea that i can manage it this way,<br>replied the americal, re slinging his rifle and taking out his strong keen edged hunting knife, after<br>dismounting and throwing his rein upon the ground over his ponys head. the sturdy little creature<br>stood gazing at it, as if full of the belief that the rein held it fast to a peg driven firmly into the<br>ground, and never attempting to move, while its master stepped to a clump of young fir trees, selecting<br>a sapling about a dozen feet high and cuttting it off close to the ground. this done, he preceeded<br>quickly to lop off all the horizontal branches close to the stem, clearing them quickly away all but the<br>thick top, where he left a luft, and on finishing, had provided himself with a rough lance whose green<br>brush like top furnished him with the weapon of offence and defence with which he intended to protect<br></P>
