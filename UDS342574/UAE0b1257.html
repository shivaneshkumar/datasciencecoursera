<P>strong and comely, with flat roof and battlements; and to this fort, every sunday, the men and women<br>walked reverently, there in arow, and in it they worshipped intil they built for themselves a meeting<br>house in as soon as each successive outlying settlement was located and established, the new<br>built a house for the purpose of assembling therein fot the public worship of god; this house was called<br>a meeting house. cotton mather said distinctly that he found no just ground in scripture to apply such<br>a trope as church to a house for public assembly. the church, in the puritans way of thinking,<br>worshipped in the meeting house, and he was as bitterly opposed to calling this edifice a church as he<br>was to calling the sabbath sunday. his favourite term for that day was the lords day. the settlers were<br>eager and glad to build their meeting houses; for these houses of god were to the, the settlers were<br>eager and glad to build their meeting houses; for these houses of god were to them the visible sign of<br>the establishment of that theocracy which they had left their fair homes and had come to new england<br>to create and perpetuate. but lest some future settlements should be slow or indifferent about doing<br>their duty promptly, it was enacted in that a meeting house should be erected in every town in the<br>colony; and if the people failed to do so at once, the magistrates were empowered to built it, and to<br>charge the cost of its erection to the town. the number of members necessary to estaablish a seperate<br>church was very distinctly given in the platform of the church discipline: a church ought not to be of<br>greater number than can ordinarile meet convenientlie in one place, nor ordinarilie fewer than may<br>convenientlie carry on church work. each church was quiet independent in its work and government, and<br>bright glow, and chris stopped to seize his neglected rein, and drag his ponys head round, urging it<br>with hand and voice to bound away along the returning track, for in the bright light of the fire the<br>boy had fully awakened to the fact that he had been riding straight for an indian encampment, right<br>in amongst the enemies he had been trying so hard to avoid forty an unconscious double. it was all<br>chris could do in his excitement and alarm to keep from crying aloud to his pony to go faster and<br>faster, though after a few strides it seemed as if the riders fear was communicated, and it was learning<br>over the rocky ground with all its might, making the stones fly as they were smillen in the furious<br>gallop. but fortunately not a word escaped between the boys firmly set teeth settling himself well down<br>in the saddle, he felt that his only chance of saving himself from being a prisoner, perhaps from a<br>horrible death, was to trust entirely to his pony, leave it free to go as it willed of the character of his<br>pursuers there was no doubt they were indians, the regular savage indians of the plains, whose<br>cruelties to settlers were the theme of many a horrible story told at camp fire and in solitary shanly<br>chris knew of their deeds well enough, but it had never entered his mind that the time would come when<br>he would be tearing through the darkness over the rugged stones of a rocky gulch, flying for his life<br>with an ever increasing pack baying and yelling at his heels. for during the first minute or two he had<br>been chased by three or foir; after that the numbers, as betrayed by their backs, fully fifty must have joined in various forms and dimensions, from a single volume, to the encyclopedia at large. the dandy may meet<br>with plenty of pretty little foolscap volumes, delightfully hot pressed, and exquisitely embellished; the<br>contents of which will neither fatigue by the quantity, nor require the laborious effort of thought to<br>comprehend, the jolly ban viviant and bacchanal will find abundance of the latest songs, toasts, and<br>sentiments; and the would be wit will meet with joe miller in such an endless variety of new dresses,<br>shapes, and sizes, that he may fancy he possesses all the collected wit of ages brought down to the<br>present moment. the young clerical will find sormons adapted to every local circumstance, every rank<br>and situation in society, and may furnish himself with a complete library on the arts of the confectionary,<br>cookery, c from apicius to the gluttons almanac. the demagogue may furnish himself with flaming<br>patriotuc speeches, ready cut and dried, which he has only to learn by heart against the next political<br>dinner, and if he should not let the cut out, by omitting to substitute the name of londonderry for<br>caesar, he may pass off for a seconf brutus, and establish an equl clain to oratory with bruke, pitt,<br></P>
