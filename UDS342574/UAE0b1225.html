<P>the offence we committed been done by any hostile tribe, hundreds of lives would have been sacrificed.<br>the next day our old friend king goerge paid us a long visit, and we talked over the affair very calmly.<br>he highly disapproved of our conduct. in the first place , said he, you did a foolish thing, which might<br>have cost you your lives; and yet did not accomplish your purpose after all, as you merely succeeded in<br>burying the flesh near the spot on which you found it. after you went away it was again taken up,<br>and every bit was eaten a fact i afterwards ascertained by examining the grave and finding it empty.<br>king george further said: it was an old custom, which their fathers practised before them; and you had<br>no right to interfere with their ceremonies. i myself, added he, have left off eating human flesh, out of<br>compliment to you white men; but you have no reason to expect the same compliance from all the<br>chiefs. what punishment have you in england for thieves and runaways we answered, after trial,<br>flagging or hanging. then, he replied, the only difference in our laws is, you flog and hang, but we<br>shoot and eat. after thus reproving us, he became very communicative on the subject of cannibalism. he<br>said, he recollected the time prior to pigs and potatoes being introduced into the island an epoch of<br>great importance to the new zealanders, and stated that he was born and reared in an inland district,<br>and the only food they then had consisted of fern roots and kumara; fish they never saw, and the only<br>flesh he then partook of was human, but i will no longer dwell on this humiliating subject. most white<br>return. did he know where they lay by day oh yes, right well he did they had a hiding place in a cave<br>down in a deep dingle, so overgrown with brushwood that only those who knew the path thither could<br>hope to penetrate within it. once there, they felt perfectly safe, and would sleep away the day after one<br>of their raids., remaining safely hidden there till supplies were exhausted, when they sallied forth again.<br>the old woodman showed them the tracks of the party that had passed by that morning, and to the<br>eyes of the gascon brothers these tracks were plain enough, and they undertook to follow them<br>unerringly to the lair. the old woodman had no desire to be mixed up in the matter, but his<br>interest was only very partially aroused, and it was plain that there was something on his own mind<br>which quite outweighed with him the subject of the forest outlaws.john would fain have questioned him<br>about himself, being a youth of kindly spirit; but the moment was not propitious, for the prince was<br>all on fire with a new idea. comrades, he said gravely and firmly, the hour has come when we must put<br>our manhood to the proof. this very day, without the loss of a needless moment, we must fall, sword in<br>hand, upon dastard crew, and do to them as they have done. you have heard this honest mans<br>tale, upon the day following a midnight raid they lie close in their cave asleep no doubt drunken with<br>require them, in the name of the catholic king his master, to surrender the island, seeing they had<br>taken it in the midst of peace between the two crowns of spain and england; and that if they would be<br>obstinate, he would certainly put them all to the sword. the pirates made answer, that the island had<br>once before belonged into the government and dominions of the king of england, and that instead of<br>surrendering it, they preferred to lose their lives. on friday the lh, three negroes, from the enemy, came<br>swimming aboard our admiral; these brought intelligence that all the pirates upon the island were only<br>seventy two in number, and that they were under a great consternation, seeing such considerable forces<br>come against them. with this intelligence, the spaniards resolved to land, and advance toward the<br>forttresses, which ceased not to fire as many great guns against them as they possibly could; which<br>were answered in the same manner on our side, till dark night. on sunday. on sunday, the lh, the day of the<br>assumption of our lady, the weather being very calm and clear, the spaniards began to advance thus:<br>the ship st. vincent, riding, admirial, discharged two whole broadsides on the battery called the<br>conception: the ship st. peter, that was vice admiral, discharged likewise her guns against the other<br>battery named st. james: meanwhile, our people landed in small boats, directing their course towards<br></P>
