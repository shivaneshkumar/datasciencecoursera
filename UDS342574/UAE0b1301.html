<P>but i soon leave it off when he goes. i did not learn stooping and poking out my chin from any one; it<br>came of itself. it is so hard to sit up; but mother says that much my worst trick is biting my finger<br>nails; and ive bitten them nearly all down to the quick. she says if i dont lose these tricks, and leave<br>off learning fresh ones, i shall never grow up like our pretty great great grandmamma. do you know<br>her, dear toby i dont think you do. i dont think you ever look at pictures, intelligent as you are its<br>the big portrait, by romney, of a beautiful lady, sitting beautifully up, with her beautiful hards lying<br>in her lap. looking over her shoulder, out of lovely eyes, with a sweet smile on her lips, in the old<br>brocade mother keeps in the chest, and a pretty lace cap. i should very much like to be like her when i<br>grow up to that age; mother says she was twenty six. and of course i know she would not have looked<br>so nice in her picture if shed squinted, and wrinkled her forehead, and had one shoulder out, and her<br>tounge in her cheek, and a round back, and her chin poked, and her fingers all swollen with biling; but,<br>oh, toby, you clever pug how am i to get rid of my tricks that is, if i must give them up; but it<br>seems so hard to get into disgrace for doing what comes natural to one, with ones own eyes, and legs,<br>and fingers, and face, loby. remove your arms from my neck, little missis i feel unusually apoplectic<br>and let me take two or three turns on the rug, whilst i turn the matter over in my mind, for never was<br>there so puzzled a pug i am, as your respected father truly observes, a most talented creature and as<br>by the children, and sometimes he heard them say their chatacize. these families he also watched<br>specially on the sabboth, and reported whether all the members thereof attended public worship. not<br>content with mounting guard over the boys on sundays, he also watched on weekends to keep boys and<br>all persons from swimming in the water. do you think his duties were light in july and august, when<br>school was out, to watch the boys of ten families one man watching one family cannot prevent such<br>violations of the peace in country towns now a days. he sometimes inspected the ordinances and made<br>complaint of any disorders which he there discovered, and gave in the names of idle tiplers and gamers,<br>and be could warn the lavern keeper to sell no more liquor to any toper whom he knew or fancied was<br>drinking too heavily. josselyn complained bitterly that during his visit to new england in at houses of<br>entertainment called ordinaries into which a stranger went, he was presently followed by one appointed<br>to that officewho would thrust himself into his company uninvited, and if he called for more drink<br>than the officer thought in his judgement he could soberly bear away, he would presently countermand<br>it, and appoint the proportion beyond which he could not get one drop the lithigman had a spetial<br>eye out on all bachelore, who were also carefully spied upon by the constables, deacons, elders, and<br>heads of families in general. he might, perhaps, help to collect the ministerial rate, though his<br>principal duty was by no means the collecting of lithes. he warned peple out of ye towne. this warning<br>was not at all because the new comers were objectionable or undesired,  but was simply a legal form of <br>to waste any but suppose he had been a grizzly said chris, bringing the glass to bear on the distant<br>animal. if it had been a grizzly i should say the best thing would be to let him alone, and the same<br>with a cinnamon, for theyre very dangerous beasts. if either of them came smelling after the mules or<br>ponies of course it would be a different thing. there wouldnt be room enough for him and us too on the<br>same mountain side. well hes gone, hasnt he yes, right up amongst the fir trees. ah, hell be much safer<br>there, said griggs. you fellows would be tempted to have a shot at him if he came within reach. now<br>then, lend me the glass. the binocular was handed to him, and while the two lads stood watching the<br>woodland patch where the bear had disappeared, in expectation of its coming into sight again, the<br>american stood sweeping the horizon and then bringing the glass to bear upon the wondrous view in<br>every direction where he could bring mountain, valley, hill, and plain into the field of the glass. he had<br>turned slowly till he was gazing in the direction from which they had come, leaving what looked like a<br>band of deep green, to bring the glass to bear upon the pale ash coloured desert part, what looked like a<br>band of deep green, to bring the glass to bear upon the pale ash coloured desert part, which rapidly<br>brightened into silvery grey, and from that become like the sea, half hidden by a soft haze which died<br>away into the sky line. quite ten minutes must have passed away, the boys having been too much<br></P>
