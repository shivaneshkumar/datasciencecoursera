<P>the men having been murdered; and i feel fully convinced no massacres will ever again be committed in<br>any of the ports in new zealand where european vessels have been accustomed to anchor. i once saw,<br>with indigination, a chief absolutely knocked overboard from a whalers deck by the male. twenty years<br>ago so gross an insult would have cost the lives of every individual on board the vessel, but, at the<br>time this occurred, it was only made the subject of complaint, and finally became a cause of just<br>remonstrance with the commander of the whaler. the natives themselves and i have heard the opinions<br>of various tribes have invariably told me that theses things occured from our want of knowledge of<br>their laws and customs, which complled them to seek revenge. it was, they saidm no act of treachery on<br>our part; we did not invite you to our shores for the purpose of plunder and murder: but you came, and<br>ill used us; you broke into our tabooed grounds, and did not alua give those bad white men into the<br>hands of our fathers i am confident that a body of europeans may now reside in perfect security in any<br>part of these islands. the late plundering of the missionaries at whangaroa was a peculiar<br>circumstance, which might have happened even in civilised europe, had the seat of war approached so<br>near their place of residence. if their houses and chapel had been on the plains of waterloo during the<br>june of they would not have experienced a better fate. this recent tumult has brought a circumstance<br>into notice highly interesting to all who may hereafter wish to settle here. it has hitherto been their<br>annoyance, for his weight had set the whole of the heap of dust in motion, bringing part into the cell<br>where they stood, while the rest glided like sand upon a slope, evidently sinking through a similar<br>opening to that which led into the next chamber, but here formed in the wall exactly opposite to the<br>window looking out on to the terrace. lend us a hand, cried griggs, and he scratched at one of those<br>stretched out to his aid, following the rest in a hurried flight out of the place, for the whole of the<br>ashes and bones were in motion and ran out through the back with a soft rushing sound. thirty six, it<br>was all a dream. ugh the dust cried bourne, as they stood together looking back through what seemed<br>like a mist. but this soon subsided, and they stepped inside again, to find that a portion of the heap<br>of remains had glided through an opening at the back, evidently the waay into another cell one that<br>was dimly lighted from somewhere above, and which proved as soon as it was examined to be the way<br>they sought, and not merely a narrow shaft, but a wide opening going upward and downward, the steps<br>being in the wall which formed the division between the two chambers. there was only a narrow landing<br>at the foot of the steps, and below this the opening seemed to go right down like a square well, into<br>whose depths the remains that disappeared had glided and lay far below. a huge cistern, said wilton<br>eagerly. no, said the doctor; the old people could not have stored their water just below the way up to<br>the next range of dwellings. more likely a great corn store or granary. yes, said the doctor. i dont fancy<br>continual deprivation of every common necessary. having made every appeal for my right, or even a<br>maintainance, without effect, i now take the liberty ofadopting the advice of some opulent friends in the<br>parish, and solicit general favour in a loan by subscription for a given time, not doubting the liberal<br>commiseration of many ladies and gentlenen, towards so great a suffere. as it is not possible to<br>describe the wrongs i have endured, the misery that has been heaped upon me, in so limited a space, i<br>shall be happy to give every explanation upon calling for the result of this entreaty and to those<br>ladies and gentlemen that condescend to favour s. whitehead with their presence, at the white hart inn,<br>borough. besides bills to an immense amount, accepted by the day of algiers, and payable by his grand<br>plenipotentiary. various sums in the english and irish funds, in the names of various trustees: in the<br>per cent. consols per cent. per cent. south sea annuilies percent. old south sea annuities per cent. per<br>cent. per cent. long annuities. besides various freehold, copyhold, and leasehold estates, reversions and<br>annuities, of incalculable value. one of the freehold, copyhold, and leasehold estates, reversions and<br>annuities, of incalculable value. one of the freehold estates is. that known by the name of irelands row,<br>and the brewhouse adjacent, mile end; the muswell hill estate; a large house in russell square, tenented<br>at present by mr. b dd for the truth of this statement, or the real existence of any property belonging<br></P>
