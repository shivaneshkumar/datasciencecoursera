<P>betake themselves to the woods, seeking out some villages where they might find relief, but all in vain;<br>for having ranged up and down the woods for some days, without finding the least comfort, they were<br>forced to return to the river, where being came, they thought convenient to descend to the sea coast<br>where they had left their ships, not having been able to find what they sought for. in this laborious<br>journey they were reduced to such extremity, that many of them devoured their own shoes, the sheaths<br>of their swords, knives, and other such things, being almost ravenous, and eager to meer aome indians,<br>intending to sacrifice them to their teeth. at last they arrived at the sea coast, where they found some<br>comfort and relief to their former miseries, and also means to seek more: yet the greatest part perished<br>through faintness and other diseases contracted by hunger, which also caused the remaining part to<br>disperse, till at last, by degrees, many or most of them fell into the same pit that lolonois did; of<br>whom, and of whose companions, having given a compendious narrative, i shall continue with the<br>actions and exploits of captain henry morgan, who may deservedly be called the second lolonois, not<br>being unlike or inferior to him, either in achievements against the spaniards or in the robberies of many<br>innocent people. the origin and descent of captain henry morgan his exploits, and the most remarkable<br>actions of his life. captain henry morgan was born in great britain, in the principality of wales; his<br>often even spend time and energy on the matter that could be spent for bette elsewhere. the only right<br>thing to do is to learn how to deal with the situation as it is. even if it were possible to improve any<br>detail of it which is anyway no more than superstitious nonsense the best that they could achieve,<br>although doing themselves incalculable harm in the process, is that they will have attracted the special<br>attention of the official for any case that comes up in the futurem and the official are always ready to<br>seek revenge. never attract attention to yourself stay calm, however much it goes against your<br>character try to gain some insight into the size of the court organism and how, to some extent, it<br>remains in a state of suspension, and that even if you alter something in one place youll draw the<br>ground out from under feet and mile fall, whereas if an enormous organism like the court is<br>disrupted in any one place it finds it easy to provide a substitute for itself somewhere else everything<br>is connected with everything else and will continue without any change or else, which is quite probable,<br>even more closed, more attentive, more strict, more malevolent. so its best to leave the work to the lawyers and not to keep disturbing them. it doesnt do much good to make accusations, especially if<br>you cant make it clear what theyre based on and their full significance, but it must besaid that<br>caused a great deal of arm to his own case by his  behaviour towards the office director, he was a very<br>influential man but now he mile as well be struck off the list of those who mile do anything for if the<br>trial is mentioned, even just in passing, its quite obvious that hes ignoring it. these official are in<br>consequently, obliged to wade knee deep through the slippery mud. we soon discovered a party of<br>women sitting round a fire made in the midst of the swa,p they had come here for the purpose of<br>procuring shell fish; and as they are never very fastidious about shelter or dry beds, they had<br>determind according to their usual custom to pass the night where they had been occupied during the<br>day. this sort of bivouac i found excessively uncomfortable. the moment we were seated the water to<br>ooze out an inch or two all round us, we sought in vain for a dry place, for we were enveloped in<br>darkness, and surrounded by rushes and flags six or seven feet high; but, being very much fatigued, we<br>slept, notwithstanding the misery of a wet bad, with a cloud of a fag for curtains. i did not wake till one<br>of the women gave me a good shake, and informed me that the day war well up. they had prepared us<br>a breakfast of hot shell fish, which they had caught the preceding day, and they all seemed delighted<br>by our eating heartily of them, as we had some biscuits in our boat, we sent for them, and gave our<br>fair founders of the feast a share and we were all very sociable and merry. when we left them, as it<br>was again low water, the women carried us to our boat, and took their leave of us amidst peals of<br>laughter this was another proof to me that the english are quite safe, through travelling unguarded,<br>amongst these people. chapterxx. loading spars at hokianga about nine the next morning we reached<br></P>
