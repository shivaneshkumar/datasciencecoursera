<P>friends, as we had always been considered as a part of gorgeous family, living under his protection,<br>adopted by him, and admitted into his tribe, i entertained great suspicious that we also should be<br>sufferers by the general plunder about to take places: besides, i was so circumstancced as to be obliged<br>to cross the country with all my goods, and my route lay through the territories of all those chiefs who<br>had been fighting against george; and i was at no loss to guess in what light they would regard me.<br>depending, too securely, on the general tranquility, i had not sent my luggage by sea, as i might have<br>done, and which would have saved me great anxiety, as i should have ventured alone without fear, but<br>could not manage to carry what i possessed; and o engage any to convey them was an impossibility,<br>for the moment i made the proposition to any even the meanest of the slaves to accompany me, they<br>ran off into the bush, nor could any entreaty, presents, or threats induce them to venture with me; so.<br>for security, i removed all the property i had, and went with it on board the marianne, whaler. for<br>three days after the death of george, all gave themselves up to grief; no work was done, and not an<br>individual was to be seen but in an agony of tears. i began to feel strangely affected with melancholy<br>myself, when, on the fourth morning, a scene of bustle took place, and low spirits were banished by<br>tumult, noise, and confusion at six o clock on that morning we discovered upwards of twenty sail of war<br>canoes, crowded with armed warriors, coming into the bag what their intentions were we could not<br>and ill go, cried ned eagerly, and the next minute he was scaling the side, and on reaching the top he<br>walked to where he was nearly over the reptile, where he picked up a couple of stones of the size of a<br>mans fist and pitched one down, with the result that the snake began to writhe violently again, but<br>only for a very brief time, before once more lying perfectly inert. no more mischief in that fellow, said<br>griggs. i may as well go down now. what about the others said chris. what others there are sure to be<br>some more. nay; rattlers are not above showing fight. if there had been any more we should have seen<br>or heard them. i shall chance it now i dont lilke your going down yet, said chris anxiously. ill have a<br>shot at him now. nay, nay; we may want our catridges for something more useful than a rattler that<br>has had as much as it wants to kill it. ill drop another stone on him, said ned, one of those big ones.<br>ah, do, said griggs take good aim, and drop it right on his head. can you see oh, yes, i can see quite<br>plainly. ned raised one of the heaviest stones near him, and often a gentle swing let it go, to fall with<br>a sharp crack upon other stones, making the snake twine again and writhe round the block, to hold on<br>tightly. why, he has pinned it down, cried chris. good aim. as he spoke the snake untwined itself and<br>straightend out, to lie perfectly still. thats done for him, cried griggs, and if there had been any more<br>that would have sent them squirming out of their holes. here, you come down, squire. im going to knot two lariats together and pass them over one of these steps. i want you to help hold on. bed descended<br>the rope was given a couple of turns round the lowest projection, and held by the two boys; the<br>praised the wine, talked of the celebrity of his house for fish, and gave an order for a dinner for<br>sixteen friends during the following week. the bait was swalloed, for a little flattery is sometimes well.<br>but are your wines of the first quality inquired the visitor; for good eating, you know, deserves good<br>drinking, and without that we shall be like fishes out of water. oh, sir, no man in london can supply<br>you better than myself was the reply; but if you please, you shall select which you may like best, my<br>stock is extensive and good. he was consequently invited into then cellar, and tasted from several binns,<br>particularly marking what he chose to conceive the best. upon returning to the parlour again bless me,<br>cried he i have had my pocket pickd this morning , and lost my handkerchief can you oblige me with<br>the loan of one for present use and i will send it back by one of my servants. certainly, sir, was the<br>reply; and the best pocket handkerchief was quickly produced, with another bottle of wine, the flavor<br>of which he had approved while below. he then wrote a letter, which he said must be dispatched<br>immediately by a ticket porter to albernarte street, where he must wait for an answer. this being done,<br>lie desired a coach to be called asked the landlord if he had nay silver he could accomodate him with,<br>as he had occasion to go a little further, but would soon return. this being complied with, by the<br></P>
