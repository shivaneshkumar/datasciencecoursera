<P>his idleness and arrogance make me quite sick, i think i want exercise , too, and i mean to have a good<br>flight to day; and, spreading his broad wings,the bird sailed away. his excursion didnot quite dispel<br>his irritability when he returned, he settled down by the captain, who was sitting listlessly, as usual,<br> with carlo at his feet if you would only exert yourself, began father albotress, something might come,<br>of it. you are getting as bad as the dog. spread cut those arms of yours, and see what you can do<br>with them if you could only fly a matter of few miles, you would see a sail and thats more than we<br>had any reason to expect.what can be the matter with the birds to day said the captain,who was in<br>rather an irritable mood himself. they are silent enough generally for the voice of the albatross is<br>rarely heard at sea. move your arms, i tell you, crooked the albatross. up and down so and follow me.<br>i shall have the dog going at them next, muttored the captain, came along, carlo, and turning his<br>back on father albatross, he moved away, he doesnt understand you, said the mother albatross, who<br>endeavoured, as in proper, to soothe her males irritability, and make peace, couldnt you take a<br>message to the ship yourself it is nothing to your magnificent wings, and it is not his fault, poor<br>creature, that he is not formed like you. you speak very sensibly, my dear said father albatross; and once more he took flight over the sea, but he returned in even worse mood than before, nothing can equal the stupidity of human beings, he observed, i addressed myself to the caption, theres an island<br>come to the ground. whether should he mount again or follow on foot he was not long irresolute, he<br>chose the later course, and, rushing through the willows where the other had passed, he paused a<br>moment on the edge of the stream. just then his enemy emerged upon the opposite bank, and, without<br>a moments halt, started off in fill run across the plain, again carlos thought of following on horseback, but the banks were high, a horse might find it difficult to ford at such a place, perhaps<br>impossible, there was no time to be lost in experiments, surely, thought carlos, i am swift as he, for a trial then and as he uttered the words he flung himself broad upon the water. a few strokes carried him<br>across the stream; and, climbing out on the opposite bank, he sprang after his retreating foe. the<br>zambo had by this time got full two hundred yards in the advance, but before he had run two hundred<br>more, there was not half that distance between them, there was no comparison in their speed. carlos<br>fairly doubled upon his terrified antagonist, although the latter was doing his utmost. he knew that he was runnign for his life not ten minutes did the chase continue, carlos drew near. the zambo heard his<br>footsteps close behid, he felt it was idle to run any longer, he halted, and once more stood at boy in<br>another instant the two were face to face, within ten feet of each other both were armed with large<br>knives their only weapons and, dim as the light was, the blades of these could be seen glittering in the<br>air, the foes scarce waited to breathe themselves, a dew angry exclamations passed between them; and<br>then, rushing upon each other, they clutched in earnest conflict it was a short conflict. a dozen seconds<br>corpse that in any way resemble him;and others declare that he was seen escaping to the forest,<br>fighting every inch of the way, with a resoulte little band around him whom none cared to follow, i<br>myself saw something of that, answered fritz; but it all seems like a dream of long ago, tell me now of<br>those who were with me caption pringle and the lad roche, are they here, and unhurt of the indians<br>they are sound and well, and though sorely exhausted by cold and hunger and fatigue when they were brought in, are fully recovered now, captain pringle is quite a hero with us,for he has told us all the story of that  disgraceful and dishonourable day of august last when the laurels of france were sorely tarnished by the breacherous villainy of her indian allies believe me,friend fritz, we men of france deplore that massacre, and cry shame upon ourselves and our countrymen for not taking sterner measures to repress it. for that reason alone, as mine uncle says we owe to you and to your companious every honour and courtesy which we can show, if we have sometimes to blush for the<br>conduct of our allies, we can show that we are capable of better things ourselves; and if we can make reporation ever so little, you will not find us backward in doing it, this indeed seemed to be the feeling<br>of those within the fort. although these men were rangers, part of the band which had harassed them<br></P>
