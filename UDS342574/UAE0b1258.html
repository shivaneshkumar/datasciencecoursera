the doors and bottom boards a<br>warm chocolate color; the window jets, comer boards, and weather boards white. what a bright nosegay<br> of color as a crowning glory brooklyn people put up an eleclarick rod on the gorgeous edif ice, and<br>proudly boasted that brooklyn meeting house was the newest biggest and yellowest in the country. one<br>and began sleeping the sides of the depression, noting the cracks and gullies running up the cliff face<br>opposite in amongst the cell like openings, all wonderfully clear and bright in the morning air, while<br>bourne and the doctor, encouraged by the discovery of the relic of the stone age, went on turning over<br>the ashes in the nest cell. meantime the party at the side of the square pit waited impatiently for the<br>stroke to rise and float out beneath the overhanging portion of the cliff above the top range of cells,<br>griggs giving the lathrn a wave now and then, sending it flying, pendulum like, as far as he could<br>reach without bringing it in contact with the smoothly cut wall not much chance for anybody or<br>anything to get out of here again if he was at the bottom, lads its a regular trap, he said. yes, but<br>take care, or youll be breaking the lanthorn, said chris warningly. nay, i wont do that , my lad, replied<br>griggs quietly but i say, squire, did you aim at its head or its tail i aimed at the part i saw moving,<br>said ned. can you see it yet nay, can you no um afraid you shot at nothing, said griggs, with a<br>laugh, and you havent killed it. im sure i saw something moving, cried ned indignantly. where is it,<br>then its clear enough to see now. gone down into a hole, perhaps. or crawled down its own throat<br>perhaps. i know, said chris merrily;
