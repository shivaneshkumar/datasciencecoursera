<P>first part pf my way with him, in his own canoe. accordingly, after having made preparations for my<br>departure, i look leave leave of all my friends at the bay of islands, both civilised and savage. i must say i<br>felt considerable regret when i found myself really going to take final leave of several native families,<br>with whom i had been on terms of intimacy since my residence here, from whom i had been on terms of intimacy since my residence here, from whom i had received many<br>proofs of personal regard, and whom, i felt  convinced, i should never meet or hear of more; none i<br>regretted parting with more than the family of poor shulitea; the mere sight of me seemed to rekindle<br>all their grief for the loss of their kinsman, and to remind them more forcibly than ever of his tragical<br>fate. his mother, old turero, in point of grief, had rivalled niobe; she had never ceased weeping and<br>lamenting from the time she heard of her sons death, and had twice attempted to struggle herself. but<br>even in the midst of her passionate sorrow, i could scarcely refrain from laughing, while observing her<br>coer and anxiety to get all she could from me. after deploring the sad fate of her dear son,  you know,<br>she continued, you promised him that you would send him a handsome new musket from sydney; and<br>now, poor felow, he is dead; and cannot shoot with it; but then you must remember that his brother<br>kiney kiney is still alive, and he can shoot with it; and poor george would wish that his brother should<br>have his new musket. this speech i felt quite irresistible; therefore, in order to comfort the old queen, i<br>promised that i would send the musket for her second son; which declaration seemed to afford her great<br>give them such a startler that theyll have had enough of it; and it must be done without our getting a<br>scratch, yes, said the doctor; but how thats what weve got to think out, sir. we ought to be a bit<br>cleverer than a set of savage indians. i vote we all make up our minds to think it out. weve got plenty<br>of time, for were all right here as to food and shelter, and cant move for a week certain. on account of<br>chris and the injured beasts, said the doctor. very well; we must all put on our wisdom caps and puzzle<br>it out. ill go and have a chat with wilton now. the little meeting broke up, and griggs went to spend<br>his short time before going on duty in cleaning his rifle, while, as if attracted to the same spot, chris<br>and ned followed him to a sheltered nook near  the place where a bucket was standing ready for sending<br>down to the running water and bringing up refilled, forty eight. the other side. as the two boys made<br>their way amongst the scattered stones they caught sight of the doctor stepping out on to the terrace<br>where wilton stood, glass in hand, scanning the opposite terraces and the sharp edge of the top, where<br>the precipe stood out clear against the sk. i wonder whether theyll hit on a good idea, said ned.<br>here, lets sit down. i say, griggs, you might be a good fellow, and give my riffle barrel a brush out too.<br>i dont say i wont, replied the american. i might give yours a touch up too, squire ill see, he continued.<br>i dont say i wont, replied the american. i might give yours a touch up too, squire. ill see, he continued.<br>i dont expect youre in very good trim for pumping water through gun barrels. no, said chris, wincing<br>as he raised his arm and lowered it again as if passing a cleaning rod through the piece. here, steady<br>cried griggs. dont take yours to pieces yet. one at a time, we might want to have another shot or two<br>and riding over corruption, c. it was soon ascertained that he had accepted an invitation from one of<br>the magistrates of bow street to pay him a visit, as he had done the day before, and was at that<br>moment going before him. i apprehend he is a little cracked, said tom; but however that may be, he is<br>a very harmless sort of person. but come, we have other game in view, and our way lies in a different<br>direction to his. clothes, sir, any clothes to day said an imporunate young fellow at the corner of one<br>of the courts, who at the same time almost obstucted their passage. amking their way as quckly as<br>they coould from this very pressing personage, who invited them to walk in. this, said tom, is what we<br>generally call a barker. i believe the little originated with the brokers in moor fields, where men of this<br>description parade in the fronts of their employers houses, incessantly pressing the passemgers to walk<br>in and buy household furniture, as they do clothes in rosemary lane, seven dials, field lane,<br>houndsditch, and several other parts of the town. ladies dresses also used to be barked in cranbourn<br>alley and the neighbourhood of leichester fields; however, the nuisance has latterly in some measure<br>abated. the shop women in that part content themselves now a days by merely inviting strangers to<br>look at their goods; but barkers are still to be found, stationed at the doors of moch auctions, who<br></P>
