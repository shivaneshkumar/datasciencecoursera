<P>floorm and tumbling clumsily up the uncarpeted creaking stairs, in other churches the member of the<br>congregation sealed themselves in their pews upon their arrival, but rose reverently when the parson,<br>dressed in black skull cap and geneva cloak, entered the door, and they stood, in token of respect, until<br>after he entered the pulpit and was seated. it was also the honor giving and deferential custom in many<br>new england churches, in the eighteenth century, for the entire congregation to remain respectfully<br>standing within the pews at the end of the service until the minister had descended from his lofty pulpit,<br>opened the door of his wifes pew, and led her with stately dignity to the church porch, where, were he<br>and she genial and neighborly minded souls, they in turn stood and greeted with carefully adjusted<br>degrees of warmth, interest, respect, or patronage, the different members of the congregation as they<br>slowly passed out. ivm the old fashioned pews. in the early new england meeting houses the seats were<br>long, narrow, uncomfortable benches, which were made of simple, rough, hand riven planks placed on<br>legs like milking stools. they were without any support or rest for the back; and perhaps the stiff<br>backed pilgrims and puritans required or wished no support. quickly as the colonies grew in wealth<br>and the colonists in ambition and importance, spots for pues were sold or pitts as they were sometimes<br>called, at first to some few rich or influential men who wished to set in a group together, and finally<br>the lad sat fast holding his fire. but at the second career something eke was evidently on the way, and<br>if possible chris set his teeth harder, for as one man went ny at a canter he leaned over towards his<br>left, raised the bow he held quickly with an arrow fitted on the string, and loosed it with a twang it<br>was aimed pretty straight, and loosed off just as the man was clearing one of the blocks of stone,<br>against whose side the arrow glanced and then whizzed by chriss head and flew over the edge of the<br>precipice, to disappear in the depths below. chriss drew a deep sigh and raised his rifle, for it seemed to<br>him that it was nearing the time when he must use it. for the indians were on in the ellipse, and<br>another man fitted an arrow to his bowstring, and as he rode by loosed it off a far better shot. there<br>was no striking against rock for it to glance off, for the next moment it struck with a heavy thud in<br>the pommel of chriss saddle, and quivered there till the lad snapped it off. a loud yell rose from the<br>cantering indians as they saw the success of the shot, and as one of the next rode by he sent his arrow<br>whizzing by the boys head, making him start nervously and raise his rifle to his shoulder; but nearly<br>a minute elapsed before he fired and lowered his piece to thrust in a fresh cartridge, setting half hidden<br>by the smoke, which screened him from his enemise at the same time that it hindered him from seeing<br>the effect of his shot, as the smoke rose it was only to slow the party cantering bt at an easy pace<br>labour, and such dangers, as they had been exposed to. but captain morgan was deaf to all this, and<br>many other like complaints, having designed to cheat them of what he could. at last, finding himself<br>obnoxious to many censures of his people, and fearing the consequence. he thought it unsafe to stay<br>any longer at chagre, but ordered the ordnance of the castle to be carried on board his ship; then he<br>caused most of the walls to be demolished, the edifices to be burnt, and as many other things ruined as<br>could be done in a short time. this done, he went secretly on board his own ship, without giving any<br>notice to his companions, and put out to sea, being only followed by three or four vessels of the whole<br>fleet. these were such as the french pirates believed as went shares with captain morghan in the best<br>part of the spoil, which had been concealed from them in the dividend. the frenchmen could willingly<br>have revenged themselves on captain morghan and his followers, had they been able to encounter him at<br>sea; but they were destitute of necessaries, and had much ado to find sufficient provisions for their<br>voyage to jamaica, he having left them unprovided for all things. the care of a large family is no light<br>matter, as everybody knows. and that year i had an unusalyy large family. no less than seven young<br>urchins for mrs. hedgehog and myself to take care of and start in life; and there was not a prickly<br>parent on this side of the brook, or within three fields beyond, who had more than four, my fathers<br>brother had six one year, i know. it was the summer that i myself was born. i can remember hearing<br>my father and mother talk about it before i could see. as these six cousins were discussed in a tone of<br></P>
