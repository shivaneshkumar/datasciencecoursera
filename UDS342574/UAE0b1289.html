<P>peevishly. i say, how would it do to keep on pitching great pieces of stone in amongst them, or<br>handfuls of small bits that would scatter and make a noise only make em savage, im afraid. i should<br>have most faith in putting a pound of powder and layimg a train ready, so that one could light a bit<br>of touch linder and get away to a safe distance. when that went off with a good explosion, i should<br>think the rattlers would scuttle away. oh, nonsense, nonsense, griggs cried chris. whos to go and lay<br>the train and place the powder ready ah, that would be awkward, said the american thoughtfully.<br>besides, if you had such an explosion youd burst the barrels. hah so we should. i say, couldnt lasso<br>the barrels, could we i can throw a noose pretty well. youd catch serpent as well as the barrels. yes,<br>and that would be nice, to have a savage rattler thrashing and striking about, trying to get his fangs<br>into you somewhere. say, chris lee, lad, weve got in a tangle. hallo i thought as much; heres the<br>doctor the gentleman in question rode slowly up. well, he said, have you found the barrels chris<br>answered him mutely by pointing to the objects of their search. very well, said the doctor. why dont<br>you oh, i see, youve just dismounted to sling them across your saddle. we were beginning to think you<br>very long. but i dont see any snakes. where are they, chris yonder, twining all about the water kegs,<br>father its alive with them. the doctor shaded his eyes with his hand and looked across at the barrels,<br>was recollected. the fire was now nearly extinguised; but our two really tolerably good houses were<br>reduced to a heap of smoking ruins, and the greater part of what belonged to us was taken away by<br>the ngapuhis. this calamity had made us acquainted with another of their barbarous customs, which<br>is, whenever a misfortune happens to a community. or an unfortunate fish, when struck by<br>a harpoon is instantly surrounded and devoured by his companions, so in new zealand, when a chief is<br>killed, his former friends plunder his widow and children; and they in revenge, ill use and even murder<br>their slaves thus one misfortune gives birth to various cruelties. during the fire, our allies proved<br>themselves the most adroit and active thieves imaginable, though previously to that event we had never<br>lost an article, although everything we possessed was open to them. when we questioned them about<br>our property, they frankly told us where it was; and, after some difficulty in settling the amount of its<br>ransom, we got most of our things back again, with the exception of such as had been carried off by<br>the ngapuhis. upon the cruelty of this custom i shall make no comments probably i should have<br>remained in ignorance of this savage law, had i not had the misfortune to become its victim. by<br>redeeming from the natives what they had purloined from the fire, we had restored to us some of our<br>boxes, desksm and clothes; but all our little comforts towards housekeeping were irretievably lost. when<br>purpose of witnessing it, it was conducted with so much fury on both sides, that at length i became<br>quite horrified, and for sometime could not divest myself of the feeling that our visitors were playing<br>fake, so closely did this mock combat resemble a real one. the dreadful noises, the hideous faces the<br>screeching of the women , and the menacing gestures of each party, were so calculated to inspire terror,<br>that slouter hearts than than mine might have felt fear. when the tumult subsided, the elder chiefs squatted<br>down, and had the long talk usual on these occasions. i was much delighted to recognise among these<br>chiefs one i had known at sydney. during his residence in that city i had permitted him to remain in<br>my house, and the few presents which he had requested on his return to his own country i had provided<br>him with, and sent him off delighted and happy, and never expected to behold him again. the moment i<br>approached he recollected me, jumped up from the council, ran up to me, hugged me in his arms, and<br>noses so forcibly with me that i felt his friendship for some time, besides being doubled all over over<br>most plentifully with red achre, which he, being then on a war like and cermonious visit, was smeared<br>with from head to foot. when my savage friend whom we used to call mr. lookee had overcome his first<br>burst of delight at seeing me, and had literally left off jumping for joy, he introduced me to his father,<br>mr. de frookee, the chief of his tribe, a very fine specimen of an old new zealander, who was i found<br>highly respected for his integrity and benevolence. his eyes overflowed with tears when he heard i was<br></P>
