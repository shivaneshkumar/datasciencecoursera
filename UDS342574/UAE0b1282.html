<P>one wins and other loses: why there have been as many moves among tilted persons, kings, queens,<br>bishops, lords and knights, within the last century, as there are in a game at chess . pawns have been taken and restored in all classes, from the soverign, who pawn or lose his crown, to the lady whose<br>reputation is in pawn, and becomes at last not worth half a crown. shuffling, culling, dealing out and<br>dealing in, double dealing and double faces, have long been the order of the day some mens cards are<br>all trumps, whilst others have carte blanche; some honours count, whilst others stand for nothing. for<br>instance, did not the little man who cast up his final accounts a short time hack at st. helena, like a<br>corsican conjurer, shuffle and cut about among kings and queens, knaves and asses, aces i mean<br>dealing out honours when he liked, and taking trumps as he thought fit did he not deal and take up<br>again almost as he pleased, having generally an honour in his sleeve to be played at command, or un<br>roi dans le marche; by which cheating, it was scarcely possible for any one to get fair play with him,<br>till, flushed by success, and not knowing how to bear his prosperity, he played too desperately and too<br>long the tables were turned upon him, and his enemies cheated him, first of his liberty, and ultimately<br>of his life, at this moment tallyho, who was listening in close attention to his cousin, struck his foot<br>against a brown proper parcel which rolled before him. hallo exclaimed he, what have we here somebody<br>all much alike. i observed their statures altered with their different latitudes; the chilians and the<br>canadians being nearly the same, in figure tall, thin, and activem their climate being nearly the same,<br>although at the two extremes of america; while those living between the equinoxes are short, fat, and<br>lazy. i am persuaded that these south sea islanders, though so nearly of the same complexion, still are<br>not of the same race, laziness being the characteristic of the american indian from north to south,<br>while the new zealanders are laborious in the extreme, as their astonishing and minute carvings prove.<br>the moment the indian lasted intoxicating spirits his valour left him, he became an idiot and a tool in<br>the hands of the white man. here they have the utmost aversion to every kind of wine or strong drink,<br>and very often severely take us to task for indulging in such an extraordinary and debasing<br>prosperity or, as they call it, of making ourselves mad; but both  nations are equally fond of tobacco<br>the first thing which struck me forcibly was, that each of these savages was armed with a good<br>musket, and most of them had also a catouch box buckled round their waists, filled with ball<br>cartridges, and those who had fired their pieces from the canoes carefully cleaned the pans, covered the<br>locks over with a piece of dry rag, adn put them in a secure place in their canoes. every person who<br>has read captain cooks account of the natives of new zealand would be astonished at the change which<br>has taken place since his time, when the firing of a single musket would have terrified a whole village.<br>as we sailed up the river very slowly, the throng of savages increased to such a degreee that we could<br>ground, said wilton excitedly, and the doctor noted that his eyes looked bloodshot and wild. here, i tell<br>you what ill take our bearings and ride off to see what i can find and then come back. no, said the<br>doctor, it is impossible. look at your horse: he cannot carry you right up yonder for miles upon miles<br>in the state he is in. then i must walk, cried wilton impetuosly you would break down before you had<br>been gone an hour, said the doctor, and we should have to search for you and bring you back. oh give<br>me credit for alittle more strength and determination, sir, said wilton petulantly. we must have water,<br>and it is to be found up wonder in the hills. what do you say, bourne i agree with you that water may<br>be found yonder, but we must keep together. our party is small enough as it is we must not make it<br>less by letting one of our most active members break away. then what are we to do cried wilton, and<br>the hoys lips moved as if they echoed his words. we must wait till dark, and then get the keys, after<br>the whole party is refreshed, we must strike up into the hills at once and search the valleys till we find<br>a fall or spring, but on no account must we seperate. so spoke the doctor, but wilton was in no<br>humuor for obeying orders. i think you are wrong, he cried. well, replied the doctor stiffly, you have a<br>right to think ss, but you might as well bear in mind that you have sworn to obey orders, that it was<br>elected to be chief of this expedition, and that it is your duty to obey in reason. do you want to<br></P>
