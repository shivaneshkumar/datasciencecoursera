<P>nearer to their angry companion, now, look here, we want your cool consideration of our position. we<br>have water a few hundred yards away. what where in the keys, which lie where i told you. oh, there<br>cried wilton contemptuously. we dont want that, but some big clear flowin spring such as i offer to<br>risk my life to find, risk your lifi in another way, said the doctor firmly. how go and fetch in the kegs<br>from where they are lying. bah if i am to die, it shall be a decent death not stung by some horrible<br>reptile. ill risk losing my way going in search of water. i have already told you, said the doctor, that<br>the state of the horses will not allow of such a search being made till they have had such water as we<br>have near. the only thing to nbe done is to contrive some way of getting the kegs here without risk.<br>exactly, said bourne laconically; but can you propose any way for i must own that i cannot without<br>horrible risk. at present no way, said the doctor sadly. my only hope is in the horrible pests returning<br>deeply under ground at night; but i am sorry to say i know very little about the habits of these<br>creatures do you, wilton no, replied their companion bitterly. latin, greek, and matematics were<br>taught me, rattlesnakes left out. but you, said the doctor, wincing at his companions contemptuous<br>manner, you, griggs, have seen a good deal of these reptiles in your time tidy bit, sir. i saw one poor<br>fellow die four hours after being bitten and ive killed a few of the varmint but ive seen more of em to day than in all my life before. then you cannot say whether it would be safe to risk an attempt to get<br>four hundred families. the merchants dwell not here, but only reside awhile, when the galleons come<br>from or go for spain, by reason of the unhealthiness of the air, occasioned by vapours from the<br>mountains; so that though their chief warehouses are at puerto bello, their habitations are at panama,<br>whence they bring the plate upon mules, when the fair begins, and when the ships belonging to the<b>company of negroes arrive to sell slaves. captain morgan, who knew very well all the avenues of this<br>city and the neighbouring coasts, arrived in the dusk of the evening at puerto de naos, ten leagues to<br>the west of pureto bello. being come hither, they sailed up the river to another harbour called pureto<br>pontin, where they anchored; here they put themselves into boats and canoes, leaving in the ships only<br>a few men to bring them next day to the port. about midnight they came to a place called estera longa<br>lemos, where they all went on shore, and marched by land to the first posts of the city: they had in<br>their company an englishman, formerly a prisoner in those ports, who now served them for a guides: to<br>him and three or four more they gave commission to take the sentinel, if possible, or kill him on the<br>places but they siezed him so cunningly, as he had no time to give warning with his musket, or make<br>any noise, and brought him, with his hands bound, to captain morgan, who asked him how things<br>went in the city, and what forces they had with other circumstances he desired to know. after every<br>opened the tompion like cover of one hung hole,letting it rattle down by the side of the empty barrel<br>and hang by its little brass chain, and then dragged at the barrel, trying vainly to bring the opening<br>down to a level with the water. oh, do something, ned, shouted chris. we ought to be on the way back.<br>shove your barrel up as high as you can. ned thrust his shoulder under the side and forced the barrel<br>up, and the wooden pack saddle gave a  little at the same time. that do he cried. yes, splendid for by<br>pressing down with all his force chris got the opening level at last with the water, which began to<br>stream in till its weight rendered the task less difficult, and by degrees the barrel down. the barrel kept its own position,<br>the air within going out in strange hollow sounds as it was dislodged. now im more than half full, ned,<br>cried chris eagerly ill hoist up my side while you draw your barrel down. this task proved more<br>difficult, but after a few tries a little water rushed into the empty receptable. then a little more and a<br>little more, till chris thrust upward with all his might, and the clear fluid ran in with a rush, till the<br>mule raised its head, shook the drops from its muzzle, and whinnied, then, feeling far less buoyant<br>from what it had drunk and the way in which the light barrels began to be turned into weights which<br>kept it steady, there was no more resistance to being led in deeper, so that with very little effort the<br>casks were lowered in turn till the water ceased to flow in, and the tompions were replaced and safely<br>secured. the water was now, at every movement made,, passing in little waves right over the mules spine,<br></P>
