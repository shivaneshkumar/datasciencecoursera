<P>maoris. feeling that i was not likely now to be called upon to act offensively, i considered myself at<br>liberate to make numerous excursions round our fortresss, not only to admire this fertile and beautiful<br>country, but to visit some of my old friends. i was very beautiful young women, whom i left only a few months back in perfect health and strngth, now<br>reduced to mere living skeletons, and also to hear of the death of others by consumption. this disease<br>seems to be the scourge of the young; and when they are once seized with its symptoms, they are very<br>speedily brought to the grave. the natives say, it is alua, the great spirit, coming into them, and<br>eating up their inside; for the patient can feel those parts gradually go away, and then they become<br>weaker and weaker till no more is left; after which the spirit sends them to the happy island. they<br>never attempt any means of curing or of alleviating the pains caused by this cruel complaint; and all<br>those under its influence are tabooed. i procured from the brig all my remaining slores of tapioca,<br>sago, arrowroot, and sugar, and distributed them in the best way i could amongst my sick friends. they<br>were anxious for wine; but that portion of my sea stock, as well as spirits, had been long since<br>expended. itseems unaccountable that the natives of an atmosphere so dry as this is a country in<br>opening a pocket book containg the necessaries he required; but first of all he pulled round the bottle<br>slung over his shoulder and carefully washed the diagonal cut. you dont think theres poison in it, do<br>you, doctor said the american, with a look of amusement. any form of dirt is poison to a wound, said<br>the doctor, drying the place; and then, after deftly drawing the edges of the wond together, cutitng<br>some strips of plaister with the bright scissors ready, and applying them to keep all protected from the<br>air hurt much he  said, as he worked away, chris watching the while as if taking a lesson. well, yes, i<br>wont say it dont, doctor; but not worse than i feel somewhere else. i say, though, hadnt we better make<br>haste back to the yes; you feel faint, dont you horribly, said griggs, giving chris a comical look.<br>lets go, then put your foot as lightly as you can to the ground, and lean on me. we must get out of<br>bowshot as quickly as we can. lchah only my nonsense, doctor, said griggs cheerily. my faintness is<br>the same as squires here. we want our breakfast horribly. oh, cried the doctor, smiling. i was afraid it<br>was from your wound. i dont wonder that you are faint, chris. but one moment, boy, do you think the<br>indians can lower themselves down over the edge of the cliff no, father; not unless they are ready to<br>drop as i did. how far cant tell, said chris, with an involunatary shudder. it was rather horrible, and i<br>wonder i wasnt killed. and i wonder too, said the doctor solemnly. i dont think that they will dare to<br>descend in the daytime, for they will be afraid that we are waiting to fire at all who show; so come on.<br>with what they want and i have to get, and what they take out to play with and lose, and what they<br>bring in to play with and leave about, bairns give some trouble, mother, and ive not an easy life of it.<br>the pay is poor enough when one can get the work, and the work is hard enough when one has a clear<br>day to do it in; but housekeeping and bairn minding dont leave a man much time for his trade. no no<br>maam, the luck of the trouts is gone, and bairns are a burden, is the motto now. though they are ones<br>own, he muttered to himself, and not bad ones, and i did hope once would have been a blessing. theres<br>johnnie, murmured the old lady, dreamily. he has a face like an apple. and is about as useful, said the<br>tailor. he might have been different, but his brother leads him by the nose. his brother led him in as<br>the tailor spoke, not literally by his snub, though, but by the hand. they were a handsome pair, this<br>lazy couple. johnnie especially had the largest and roundest of foreheads, the reddest of cheeks, the<br>brightest of eyes, the quaintest and most twitchy of chins, and looked altogether like a gutta percha<br>cherub in a chronic state of longitudnal squeeze. they were locked together by two grubby paws, and<br>had each an armful of mass, which they depositeed on the floor as they came in. ive swept this floor<br>once to day, said the father, and im not going to do it again. put that rubbish outside. move it,<br>johnnie said his brother, seating himself on a stool, and taking out his knife and apiece of wood, at<br>which he cut and sliced; while the apple cheeked johnnie stumbled and stamped over the moss, and<br>scraped it out on the doorstep, leaving long trails of earth behind him, and then sat down also. and<br></P>
