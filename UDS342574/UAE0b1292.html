<P>by the others, and asked her as they went up side by side, is there a painter, litorelli, who lives here<br>the girl, hardly thirteen years old and somewhat hunchbacked, jabbed him with her elbow and looked<br>at him sideways. her youth and her bodily defects had done nothing to stop her being already quiet<br>depraved. she did not smile once, but looked at earnestly, with sharp, acquistive eyes. pretended not to<br>notice her behaviour and asked, do you know litorelli, the painter she nodded and asked in reply, what<br>dyou want to see him for thought it would be to his advantage quickly to find out something more<br>about litorelli. i want to have him paint my portrait. he said, paint your portrait she asked, opening<br>her mouth too wide and lightly hitting with her hand as if he had said something extraordinarily<br>surprising or clumsy, with both hands she lifted her skirt, which was already very short, and, as fast<br>as she could, she ran off after the other girls whose indistinct shouts lost themselves in the heights at<br>the next turn of the stairs, however, encounter all the girls once more. the hunchbacked girl had<br>clearly told them about k.s intentions and they were waiting for him. they stood on both sides of the<br>stairs, pressing themselves against the wall so that could get through between them, and smoothed<br>their aprons down with their hands. all their faces, even in this guard of honour, showed a mixture of<br>childishness and depravity. up at the head of the line of girls, who now, laughing, began to close in<br>he was very tired and everything dragged itself lethargivally through his head, this belef of his seemed<br>irrefutable. he no longer felt the contempt for the trial that he had had earlier. if he had been alone in<br>the world it would never have arisen in the first place. but now, his uncle had already dragged him to see<br>the lawyer, he had to take account of his family; his job was no longer totally seperate from the<br>progress of the trial, he himself had carelessly with a certain, in explicable complacency mentioned it to<br>acquaintainces and others had learned about it in ways he did not know, his relationship with miss<br>biirstner seemed to be in trouble bacause of it. in shortm he no longer had any choice whether he would<br>accept the trial or turn it down, he was in the middle of it and had to defend himself. if he was tired,<br>then that was bad. but there was no reason to worry too much before he needed to. he had been<br>capabale of working himself up to his high position in the bank in a relatively short time and to retain<br>it with respect from everyone, now he simply had to apply some of the talents that had made that<br>possible for him to trial, and there was no doubt that it had to turn out well. the most important<br>thing, if something was to be achieved, was to reject in advance any idea that he mile be in any wau<br>guilty. there was no guilt. the trial was nothing but a big piece of business that concealed many lurking<br>at the foot of the steps, and below this the opening seemed to go right down like a square well, into<br>whose depths the remains that disappeared had glided and lay for below. a huge cistern, said wilton<br>eagerly. no, said the doctor; the old people could not have stored their water just below the way up to<br>the next range of dwellings. more likely a great corn store or grannary. yes, said bourne, that seems<br>likely; but griggs grunted and said nothing. what do you think, then said the doctor. i dont fancy<br>those old folks would do much farming and corn growing, sir, replied griggs. you see, its a rocky sort<br>of place all about here, with very little soil except in patches, and a short supply of water. flocks and<br>herds must have been more in their way. then what would have been the use of a place like this griggs<br>was silent for a few moments, and then he laconically uttered the word trap a trap cried chris<br>wonderingly. what could they catch up here enemies, replied the american, as he stood looking down<br>and then up. what are you thinking said the doctor quickly. only this, sir, perhaps im wrong, but you<br>see this is a stronghold, and i cant help thinking that this is the only way into it. there was the first<br>row of dwelling places, got at only by a ladder, up which the enemy had to fight their way, and they<br>seemed to have killed all that were defending that part before fighting their way up to the second row,<br>there they did the same, and here must have been the way up to the top part, which they tried to<br>make stronger still. you see, its rather a ticklish bit up the side there, and plenty of room all round<br></P>
