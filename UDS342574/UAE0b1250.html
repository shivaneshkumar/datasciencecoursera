<P>below, and four or five escaped up the rigging, and in a few seconds the savages had complete<br>possession of the ship. the boy dvies escaped into the hold, where he lay concealed for several days,<br>till they were fairlyglutted with human blood, when they spared his life. the woman says she was<br>discovered by an old savage, and that she moved him by her tears and embraces; that at this time<br>the deck was covered with human bodies, which they were employed in cutting up; after which they<br>exhibited a most horrid dancee and song in honour of their victory, and concluded by a hymn of<br>gratitude to their god. tippahee now look the speaking trumphet, and hailing the poor wretches at the<br>mast head. told tham to unbend the sails, they readily compiled; but when he ordered them to come<br>they hesitated, but he enforced prompt obedience by threatening to cut away the masts. when they<br>came down he received them with much civility, and told them he would take care of them; he<br>immediately ordered them into a canoe, and sent then on shore, a few minutes after this the woman<br>went on shore with her deliverer. the first object that struck her view was the dead bodies of these men,<br>lying naked on the beach. as soon as she landed a number of men started up, and marched towards her<br>central tableland some two thousand feet up stood the remains of the city of which he had been in<br>search. this proved to be completely ruined, one mass of crumbling stone wall; but every here and there<br>he discovered proofs that the old inhabiatants had utilised the rich metal contained in the hills by which<br>they were surrounded. the place had evidently been destroyed in some catastrophe, in all probability by<br>the attack of an enemy, for not a trace save charred beams remained of the woodwork that must have<br>been plentifully used, and in many parts he found the scattered and gnawed bones of the slain. i should<br>like to explore that place, doctor and neighbours all, said griggs, but im afraid that the nation of<br>people who built that city belonged to the imagination. that was my own idea, said the doctor gravely,<br>especially when the poor fellow told me that he made his home there for years, taking possession of a<br>little temple like place, covering the roof in with cedar boughs to keep off the sun, and living upon<br>what we could secure by means of his gun. and always getting a fresh supply of powder and shot from<br>noo york by mail, eh, neighbours the narrative is most improbable, continued the doctor, but it does<br>contain elements open to belief. but if he had discovered such treasure as that, said wilton, why didnt<br>he get back to civilisation, so as to profit by it to be sure, said bourne. but what about the indians<br>who ought to have been there to watch over the gold he did not mention them, replied the doctor; but<br>his reason for not returning was that the poor fellow felt that he dared not attempt to go through the<br>same horrors that he had encountered on his way out. he had friends with him then, but now he was<br>alone, weak, and wanting in spirit. in fact, much as he longed to get back to civilisation, he dared not<br>attempt the journey, but kept on putting it off for years.  for years, eh said griggs derisively. yes, for<br>performance of this he was subjected to a double disappointment, for his rencontre with the hibernians<br>had silvered the fragile ornament to atoms in his pocket, and before he could draw fourth the useless<br>fragments, the more important object of his attention was beyond the power of his visual orbs. it might<br>have been worse, said he, as he surveyed the broken bauble: it is a loss which can easily be repaired,<br>and id in losing that, i have prevented more serious mischief. there is at least some consolidation.<br>apropas, here is the very place for supplying the defect without loss of time. dixon, continued he<br>looking at this gentleman, whose persevering endeavours in his profession entitle him to the patronage<br>of the public, without pretending to second sight, or the powers that are so frequently attributed to the<br>seventh son of a seventh son, has thrown some new lights upon the world. although he does not pretend<br>to make helps to read, his establishment at no., newman street, oxford road, of upwards of thirty years<br>standing, is deservedly celebrated for glasses suited to all sights, manufactured upon principles derived<br>from long study and practical experience. indeed, if we are to place any reliance on his advertisements,<br>he has brought them to a state of perfection never before attained, and not to be surpassed. the name<br></P>
