<P>no, if you think you can get by without litorelli illl certainly be better to leave him completely out of<br>it. maybe youve already got a clear idea of what youre doing and litorelli could upset your plans. no,<br>if thats the case then of course you shouldnt go there under any circumstances and it cerainly wont be<br>easy to take advice form a lad like that. still, its up to you. heres the letter of recommendation and<br>heres the address. disappointed, took the letter and put it inn his pocket. even at best, the advantage he<br>mite derive from this recommendation was incomparably smaller than the damage that lay in the face<br>of the manufacturer knowing about his trial, and that the painter was spreading the news about, it<br>was all he could manage to give the manufacturer, who was already on his way to the door, a few<br>word of thanks. ill go there, he said as he took his leave of the manufacturer at the door, or, as im<br>very busy at present, ill write to him, perhaps he would like to come to me in my office some time. i<br>was sure youd find the best solution, said the manufacturer. although i had thought youd prefer to<br>avoid inviting people like this litorelli to the bank and talking about the trial here. and its not always<br>a good idea to send letters to people like litorelli, you dont know what mite happen to them. but youre<br>bound to have thought everything through and you know what you can and cant do. nodded and<br>accompained the manufacturer on through the ante room. but despite seeming calm on the outside he<br>heres a hole that may hold one. all right, was the reply, and as chris planted his feet firmly, one in a<br>hole and the other on a projecting stone, wilton uttered a warning word or two, which the boys were<br>too busy to heed. its a bigger place than i thought, said chris, taking fast hold of a stone with his<br>left hand and advancing his tufted staff with his right, as be stood well upright, bringing his head<br>above the edge of the hole. it was built up once, for the stones were square, and it goes in quite deep.<br>now, then, look out for a big one. he leaned a little on one side, thrust in the stick, and gave it a<br>sharp rattle round in different directions, when to his horror there was a rush which nearly made him<br>loosen his hold before he realised what had happened. but fortunately he held on, and in an instant the<br>alarm and danger had passed away. for the occupants he had disturbed proved to be some half dozen<br>huge bats, which fluttered out, squealing, and made for the opposite side of the depression. phew how<br>they smell cockroachy, cried chris, i say , farther, there are not likely to be snakes here now, no, said<br>the doctor. if there were i should not think that you would have found the bats. but be careful. chris<br>said nothing, but climbed right into the hole. here, come on, ned, he cried; this isnt a hole made by<br>some stone falling over; its quite a little chamber, with whats that he added a chimney a minutes<br>investigation proved that it was no chimney that had taken his attention, but a sloping shaft with<br>plenty of room for man to pass upward, and the way made easy by projecting stones. you are not<br>going in there said ned anxiously, as he stood close behind. but i am. come and look. you can see<br>may either said ned anxiously, as he stood close behind. but i am. come and look. you can see<br>may either eat you or be eaten by you. and if you want peace and quiet, where can one bury oneself so<br>safely and completely as in the mud a state of existence, without mud at the bottom, mmust be a life<br>without repose. i was in the mud one day, head downwards, when human voices came to me through the<br>water it was summer, and the pond was low at the time . oh, francis francis the water soldiered is in<br>flower. hooray dig him up for the aquarium grandfather says its very rare doesnt he he says its not at<br>all common; and theres only one, francis. it would be a pity if we didnt get it up the roots, and it<br>died. nonsense, molly ill get it up. but lets get the beasts first. you get the pickle jar ready, whilst i<br>fix the stick on to the calender. does cook know youve taken it, francis by this time she does, i should<br>think. look here, molly i wish you would try and get this stick right. it wants driving through the<br>handles. im just going to have a look at the water soldier. you always give me the work to do, molly<br>complained; and as she spoke, i climbed up an old stake that was firmly planted in the mud, and<br>seated myself on the top, which stood out of the water, and looked at her. she was a neat looking little<br>soul, with rosy cheeks, and a resolute expression of countenance. she looked redder and firmer than<br>usual as she drove the broomstick through the handles of the calender, whilst the boy was at the other<br>side of the pond with the water soldier, whose maiden blossom shone white among its sword leaves. it<br></P>
