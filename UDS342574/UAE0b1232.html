<P>the fort of st. jerome; that at the same time all his fleet would draw near the castle of santa teresa,<br>and attack it by land, landing, iin the meanwhile, more troops near the battery of st. matthew: that<br>these troops being newly landed, should by this means intercept the governor as he endeavoured to to st. jeromes<br>fort, and then take him prisoner; using the formality, as if they forced him to deliver the<br>castle; and that he would lead the english into it, under colour of being his own troops. that on both<br>sides there should be continual firing, but without bullets, or at least into the air, so that on both<br>sides there should be continual firing, but without bullets, or at least into the air, so that no side<br>might be hurt. that thus having obtained two such considerable forts, the chiefest of the isle, he need<br>not take care for the rest, which must fall of course into his hands. these propositions were granted by<br>captain morgan, on condition they should see them faithfully observed; otherwise they should be used<br>with the atmost rigour: this they promised to do, and look their leave, to give account of their<br>negotiation to the governor, presently after, captain morgan commanded the whole fleet to enter the<br>port, and his men to be ready to assault, that night, the castle of st. jerome. thus the fake battle<br>began, with incessant firing from both the castles, against the ships, but without bullets, as was<br>agreed. then the pirates landed, and assaulted by night the lesser island, which they took, as also both<br>fortress; forcing the spaniards, in appearance, to fly to the church, before this assault, captain<br>morgan sent word to the governor, that he should keep all his men together in a body; otherwise, if the<br>halting human judgment the significant checks, the deacon had also to see that this religionistic ticket<br>was presented on the communion sabbath. great must have been the disgrace of one who found himself<br>checkless at the end of the month, and greater evn than the heart burnings over seating the meeting<br>must have been the jealousies and church quarrels that arose over the communion checks. and yet no<br>records of the protests or complaints of indignant or grieving parishioners can be found, and the<br>existence of the loo worldly, too business like checks are, however, still in existence. they are ablong discs of<br>pewter, about an inch and a half long, bearing the initialsp p.,which stand, it is said, for pelham<br>presbyterian. i could not but reflect, as i looked at the simpe little stamped slips of metal, that in a<br>community so successful in the difficult work of counterfeiting coin, it would have been very easy to<br>form a mould and cast from it spurious checks with which to circumvent the deacons and preserve due<br>dignity in the meeting. the presbyterian checks have never been attributed in massachusetts to other<br>than the pelham church, and are usually found in towns in the vicnity of pelham church gave<br>to many of his friends these presbyterian checks, which he had found among the disused and valueless<br>church propertiess, and the little relics of the old time deacons and services have been carefully<br>sharpers, whoresm thieves, and depredators of all descriptions, for ever on the look out, it is not long<br>since a man was thrown froma two pair of stairs window in charles street, which is just by, having<br>been decoyed into a house of ill fame by a cyprian, and this in a sitution within sight of the very<br>police office itself in bow street huzza ha, ha, ha, there he goes., vaciferated by a variety of voices, now<br>called their attention, and put an end to their conversation; and the appearance of a large concourse of<br>people running up drury lane, engrossed their notice as they approached the other end of russel court.<br>on coming up with the crowd, they found the cause of the vast assemblage of persons to be no other<br>than a quaker decorated with a tri coloured cockade, who was a circumstance of a truly alarming and<br>distrssing nature, to which should serve as a lesson to similar adventures, it appeared that a young<br>man had been induced to enter a house of ill fame in charles street, covent garden, by one of its<br>cyprian inmates, to whom he gave some money in order for her to provide them with supper; that, upon<br>her return, he desired to have the difference between what he had given and what she had expended<br>returned to him, which being peremptorily refused, he determined to leave the house. on descending the<br>stair case for which purpose, he was met by some men, with whom he had a violent struggle to escape;<br></P>
