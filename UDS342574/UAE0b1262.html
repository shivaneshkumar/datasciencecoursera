<P>distinkly. robert may have been a good drummer, but he proved to be a most reprehensible and<br>disreputable citizen; in the local court record of august, , we find a full report of an astounding<br>occurence in which he played an important part. ten men, who avere nearly all sea faring men, gay,<br>rollicking sailors, went to bassetts house and asked for strong drink. the magistrates had endeavored<br>zealously, and in the main successfully, to prevent all intoxication in the community, and had<br>forbidden the sale of liquor save in very small quatities. the church drummer, however, wickedly<br>unmindful of his honored calling, furnished to the sailors six quarts of strong liquor, with which they<br>all, host and visitors, got prodigiously durnk and correspondingly noisy. the court record says: the<br>miscarriage comtinued till betwixt tenn and eleven of the clock, to the great provocation of god,<br>disturbance of the peace, and to such a height of disorder that strangers wondered at it. in the midst of<br>the carousal the master of the pinnace called the boatswain brother loggerheads. this must have been a<br>particularly insulting epithet, which no respectable boatswain could have been expected quietly to<br>endure, for at once the two men fell fast to wrestling, then to blowes and therein grew to that feireness<br>that the master of the pinnace thought the boatswain would have puled out his rein. no, no steady; its<br>going to be a long ride, and you mustnt be pumped out for hours to come. thats better; a nice gentle<br>canter. well done how light and easy you do go. it was as if the beautiful little animal understood its<br>riders words. it certainly did his caresses, for it snorted loudly, tossed up its head, and then bending it<br>down with neck finely arched, it progressed in bound after bound as if it were a joy to be cantering<br>along that high level ground in the pure elastic air. chris gave his mount another pat or two upon the<br>neck, and then settling himself in his saddle he turned his head to watch the indians. in an istant he<br>had learned that not only could they see him but they had grasped his intention as to the way in<br>which he sought to escape. for directly after, three of them had darted out of the line and gone off at<br>full speed, opening out the while, with the evident intention of cutting off their victim, chris was ready,<br>and after riding a little way so as to give the enemy time, he suddenly bore upon his rein and changed<br>his course. but as soon as this was seen, three more of the indians started off to turn him away from<br>the open country in that direction. again chris changed, each time increasing his speed; but in this,<br>and in the efforts which followed, the indians grasped his ideas, and they galloped out to cut him off,<br>till after trial following trial the fugitive found that his efforts to escape in that way could only result<br>in tiring out his mustang, and so cleverly had the enemy manoeuvred that they had cast. as it were, a<br>what they came for. next morning, about break of day, they came with their ships ashore, and landed<br>their men, although the spaniards made good resistance from a battery they had raised on that side,<br>where, of necessity, they were to land; but they were forced to retire to a village, whither the pirates<br>followed them. here the spaniards rallying, fell upon them with great fury, and maintained a strong<br>combat, which lasted till night; but then, perceiving they had lost a great fury, and maintained a strong<br>combat, which lasted till night; but then, perceiving they had lost a great number of men, which was<br>no less on the pirates side, they retired to secret places in the woods. next day the pirates seeing them<br>all fled, and the town left empty of people, they pursued them as far as they could, and overtook a<br>party of spaniards, whom they made prisoners, and exercised with most cruel torments, to discover their<br>goods. some were forced, by intolerable tortures, to confess; but others, who would not were used more<br>barbarously thus, in fifteen days that they remained there, they took many prisoners, much plate and<br>movables, with which  booty they resolved to return to hispaniola; yet not content with what they had<br>got, they dispatched some prisoners into the woods to seek for the rest of the inhabitants, and to<br>demand a ranson for not burning the town. they answered, they had no money nor plate; but if they<br>would be satisfied with a quantity of maize, they would give as much as they could. the pirates<br>accepted this, it being then more useful to them than ready money, and agreed they should pay four<br>thousand hanegs, or bushels of maize. these were brought in three days after, the spaniards being<br></P>
