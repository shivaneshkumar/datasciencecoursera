<P>positions were, no more had i, and we both have to do our duty and make the best of life as we found<br>it. its a very good thing, dear child, to get into the habit of saying to oneself, one cant have<br>everything, i suppose james learned to say it, for he has lived with me ever since, at this, moment<br>joseph called to me through the open window which led into the garden oh, selina i am so sorry; but<br>when i got to the shop i couldnt remember whether it was, a quarter of a yard of ribbon or three<br>quarters that you wanted for the dolls hat. joseph was always, doing stupid things like this, it vexed<br>me very much, and i pimped up and hastily seized my doll to go out and speak to him. saying, as, i<br>did so, that boys were enough to drive one wild, and one might as well ask the poodle to do anyhting<br>as joseph, and it was, not till i had flounced out of the drawing room that i felt rather hat and<br>uncomfortable to remember that i had tossed my bead, and knitted my brows, and jerked my chin, and<br>pouted my lips, and shakenn my skirts, and kicked up my heels, as, i did so, and that my godmother<br>had probably been observing me through her gold eye glasses, it is easier to prevent ill habits, than to<br>break them, old proverb, i must say that joseph was rather a stupid boy. he was, only a year younger<br>than me, bit i never could make him understand exactly what i wanted him to do when we played<br>together; and ire was always saying, on, i say, look here, selina and proposing some silly plan of his<br>own. but he was, very good natured, and whem we were alone i let him be uncle to the dolls, when we<br>spent the day with maud mary, however, we never let him play with the baby house; bit we allowed<br>that last charge. what could she have known or cared for saut and its domain she had fled hither from<br>england, i know not why. she knew but little of the ways and the thoughts of those amongst whom she<br>had come to dwell, it might well have been of her own land that she was, thinking so oft. i verily<br>believe that basildene is our lost inheritance, basildene said gaston quickly, with a start as, of<br>recollection suddenly stirred to life; sure i remember the name right well now that thy words, bring it<br>back to mind, yet it is years since i have heard it spoke, raymond, knowest thou where is this<br>basildene in england, i well believe, was. the answer of the other brother, methinks it was the name of<br>our mothers, home. i seem to remember bow she told us of it the old house over the sea, where she had<br>lived, perchance it was, once her own in very sooth, and same turbulent baron or jealous kinksman drove<br>her forth from it was, even as we of the house of de brocas have been ousted from the castle of saut.<br>brother, if that be so, basildene is more our inheritance than you gloomy fortress can be. we are our<br>mothers only children, and when she joined our bands, together she called us the twins of basildene. i<br>trow, that we have an inheritance of our very own, gaston, way over the blue water yonder, gastons<br>eyes, flashed with sudden ardour and purpose, often of late had the twins talked together of the future<br>that lay before them, of the doughty deeds, they would accomplish; yet so far nothing of definite<br>purpose had entered into their minds, gastons dreams, had been all of the ancient fortress of saut, now,<br>is the one point upon which he is obstinately heretical. but you still have hopes of inducing him to<br>submit i shall not cease my efforts, or ceast to hope, answered dr. bigdon earnestly, for in truth i know<br>not whar will be the end if he remain obstinate or, rather, i fear too much what that end will be. if it<br>lay with the cardinal, there would be hope; but the bishop is. obdurate, he is resoked to proceed to the<br>uttermost lengths, pray heaven clarke may yet see the folly of remaining obstinate, and may consent<br>at the last to submit as, the others, have done have all done so there is dalaber yet to win, answered the<br>dean, and there are a fewmore ssumner for one, and radley for another who have not given the<br>assurance yet. if clarke would submit, they would do so instantly; but they are near to him in the<br>prison, and they can speak with each other, and so they hang together as yet, and what he does they<br>will do. but their peril is not so great as his. the bishop has, not named any, save garret, ferrar, and<br>clarke, as the victims of the extreme penalty of the law dalaher may well be included if he remains<br>obdurate, and therefore i am greatly concerned that he should be persuaded. think you that you can<br>work upon him, were i to win you permission to see him i have heard that you did visit him while<br>since, when he was kept less strictly than is now the case. what was his, frame of mind then and what<br></P>
