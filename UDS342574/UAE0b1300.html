<P>face from the point of her chin up her right cheek to her forehead, and then from her forehead down<br>her left cheek back to her chin, and he found that she was a very nice thing too. but the dairymaid<br>screamed, good gracious where did that nasty strange dog come fom leave him alone, miss daisy, or<br>hell bite your nose off. he wont said daisy indignantly. hes the dog daddy isnt this my dog bless the child, no said<br>the farmer; its a nice little pup im going to give thee. where did that dirty old brute come from he<br>would wash, said little daisy, holding very fast to flaps coat. fine washing too said the dairymaid, and<br>his hairs all lugs. i could comb them, said daisy. hes no but got one eye, said the swinehead. haw how<br>haw he sees me with the other, said daisy. hes looking up at me now. and one of his ears gone cried<br>the dairy lass. he he he perhaps i could make him a cap, said daisy, as i did when my doll lost her<br>wig. it had pink ribbons and looked very nice. why, hes lame of a leg, guffawed the two farming men<br>see, missy, he hirples on three. i cant run very fast, said daisy, and when im old enough to, perhaps<br>his leg will be well. why you dont want this old thing for a play felloe, child said the farmer. i do i<br>do wept daisy. but why in the name of whims and whamsies because i love him, said daisy. when it<br>comes to this with the heart, argument is wasted on the head; but the farmer went on: why hes neither<br>useful nor ornamental. hes been a good dog in his day, i dare say; but now at this moment flaps threw<br>his head up in the air and sniffed, and his one eye glared, and he set his teeth and growled. he smell<br>deacons that the bible should be read and expounded to them, or a sermon be read to keep them quiet<br>during the nooning. occasionally some old patriarch would explain to them the notes that he had taken<br>during the morning sermon. more unbearable still, the boys were sometimes ordered to explain the notes<br>during the morning sermon. more unbearable still, the boys were sometimes ordered to explain the notes<br>which they had taken themselves. i would i had heard some of those explanations thus they litreally,<br>as was written in, throve on the good fare of brown beard and the gospell. in andover, judge phillips<br>left in his will a silver flagon to the church as an expression of interest and hope that the laudable<br>practice of reading between services may be continued so long as even a small number shall be disposed<br> to attend the exercise. mr. abbott left another silver flagon to the andover church to encourage reading<br>between services; though how this piece of plate encouraged personally, since neither the deacons nor<br>the boys got ot as a prize, cannot be preciselt understood. the noon house in andover was a large<br>building with a great chimney and open fireplace at either end. it has always seemed to me a piece of<br>gratuitous posthumous cruelty in judge phillips and mr. abbott to try to cheat those andover boys of<br>their noon time rest and relaxation, and to expect them, wriggling and twisting with repressed vitality,<br>to listen to a long extra sermon, read perhaps by some unskilled reader, or explained by some<br>incapable expounder. the sabboth school did not then exist, and was not in general favor until the noon<br>houses had began to disappear. the reverend jedediah morse, father of the inventor of the electric<br>the nearest bushes and trees.why, its to morrow, morning, cried the boy excitedly. ah, thats what you<br>ought to have said last night, my boy, said the doctor, laughing, as he pressed neds side with his toe,<br>come, ned, lad: breakfast. ned sprang up as sharply as if he had been kicked. eh what he cried. oh<br>weve been to sleep. ofcourse you have, said the doctor. you lay down to sleep, didnt you no, father; we<br>lay down to keep awake till it was time to call you, cried chris. oh, yes, i know griggs told me; but<br>you didnt keep awake. now then, go and have a wash, and then come and help me do some cooking. be<br>sharp one moment. father. have you heard or seen any indians no, not one. and look here; youll be<br>attending to the fire when you come back; dont make it up with green wood, but pick up the pieces of<br>the dry and dead. i dont wont more smoke than we can possibly help to be rising up above the trees.<br>now: off there was water near at hand, but no time to undress for a swim. and the boys were soon<br>back, with the stiffness produceed by the previous days exertion dying out before the bright buoyancy<br>produced by a sound sleep in the beautiful cool, elastic air, while the feeling of ravenous appetite that<br>began to attack them made their task of shifting wooden fresh green spits, rather than skewers, laden<br>with pieces of bird, from place to place, where they could catch most heat from the glowing embers, one<br></P>
