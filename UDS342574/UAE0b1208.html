<P>inspect the fleet, and discuss with the admirals what ships should be chosen for the service, finally, the<br>sutherland was selected as the ship to run the gauntlet, on account of her sailing capacities and the<br>excellence of her sailing master and crew. a frigate was to accompany her, and several smaller vessels,<br>one of which. to his, great satisfaction, was killicks; and he was permitted to lead the way, as his,<br>shrewdness and skill in nautical matters were well known throughout the fleet, colonel carleton, a <br>promising and experienced officer, was in charge of the troops. but wolfe himself could not be far away.<br>he was to watch everything from point levi, and in the event of success to superintend the passage<br>overlang of the flotilla of boats; and in one of these he purposed himself to join the expedition in the<br>upper river, and make a careful survey of the defences there. dearly would he have liked to make one of<br>the daring party who were to run the gauntlet of the french batteries, but be knew his responsibilities<br>as general of the forces too well to expose himself rashly where he could not take the lead, he must<br>trust to the sailors for this thing; his turn would come later. all was is readiness. the selected vessels<br>were lying at anchor, ready to loose from the moornings when the sun had sunk, walfe in his light<br>boat, managed by humphery and fritz, had made a tour of inspection, and was now speeding across the<br>water towards point levi, up the heights of which several additional powerful guns had been carried<br>earlier in the day to assist in the cannonade planned for the night. little was spoken by the general or<br>force behind her life, gently nudging her into different directions and into different experiences. she felt<br>that it was important to somehow try to get in tune with this force and not to get upset when things<br>did not go exactly her way, but to accept gracefully the bad with the good and to try to learn from<br>each experience. she sensed that if she did this, and especially if she asked for guidance each day, that<br>perhaps same of the bad experiences that she was yet to go through in her life might not be as harsh<br>as they otherwise would have been. she realized that her own attitude during each experience was the<br>key to the whole thing. if she allowed herself to become agitated and upset over every little thing that<br>happened, or over the way other people behaved or talked, her life weald be one of constant turmoil.<br>but if she maintained a positive, optimistic attitude and did not allow the negativity of others to affect<br>her, and if she tried to understand the motivation behind others actions and words and tried to help<br>them where she could, her own life would he happier and more meaningful. she knew that a great deal<br>of what others said or did was through lack of understanding. she vaguely remembered a saying<br> somewhere: forgive them, for they know not what they do. well, here we are. the lions voice awoke her<br>from her thoughts as they approached the red belt, dirithy could sense a strange vibration. it was not<br>at all unpleasant; in fact, as they got closer, she felt a warm glow all over, as they were about to<br>enter, a young lady appeared in front of them. she was tall and beautiful, with long black hair, and<br>were passing on, when i held him back with another exclamation. oh look at the carnations for in one<br>of the gardens large clumps of splendid scarlet cloves caught my eye. my father humoured me, and we<br>drew, near to the laurustinus hedge, and looked over into the gay little garden, as we looked, we became<br>conscious of what happened like a heap or bundle of clothing near one of the beds, which on lifting<br>itself up, proved to be a tall slender lady of middle age, who with her dress lucked neatly round her, a <br>big print hood on her head and a trowel in her hand, was busily administering such lender little<br>attentions as mothers will lavish on their children, and garden lovers on their flowers, she was not<br>alone in the garden, as we soon perceived, a shorter and stouter and younger lady sat knilling by the<br>side of a gentleman in a garden chair, who from some defect in his sight, wore a large green shade,<br>which hid the greater part of his face. the shade was made of covered pasteboard, and was large and<br>round, and so very like a lamp, shade, that i hardly ever look at one of those modern round globe<br> lamps, my dear, if it has a green shade, without being reminded of old mr. brooke. was that his name<br>ida asked yes, my dear; but that we did not know till afterwards. when the good lady lifted herself up,<br>she saw us, and seemed startled. my father raised his hat and apologized politely. my little girl was<br>so much taken with your carnations, madam, he said, that we made bold to come near enough to look<br>
