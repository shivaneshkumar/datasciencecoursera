<P>century ago, the pretty feathery pale green shrub grew in every country door yard, humble or great,<br>throughout new england; and every church going woman picked a branch or spray of it when she left<br>her home on sabbath morn. to this day, on hot summer sundays, many a staid old daughter of the<br>puritans may be seen entering the village meetong house, clad in a lilac sprigged lawn or a green<br>striped barege, a scanty skirted, surplice waisted relic of past summers, with  a lace bordered silk cape<br>or a delicate, time yellowed, purple and white cashmere scarf on her bent shoulders, wearing on her<br>gray head a shirred silk or leghorn bonnet, and carrying in her lace milled hand a fresh handkerchief,<br>her spectacle case and well worn bible, and a great sprig of the sweet, old fashioned lads love. a rose, a<br>bunch of mignonette would be to her too gay a posy for the lords hous and the lords house and the lords day. and<br>balmier breath than was ever borne by blossom is the pare fragrance of green growing things,<br>southernwood, mint, sweet fern, bayberry, sweetbrier. no rose is half so fresh, so countrified, so sweet. the benches<br>and the pew seats in the old churches were never cushioned. occasionally very old or<br>feeble women brought cushions to meeting to sit upon. it is a matter of recent tradition that colonel<br>greenleaf caused a nine days talk in newbury town at the beginning of this century when he cushioned and<br>lined and curtained with worsted stuff, and carpeted with a heavy bear skin. this worn, faded, and moth<br>hole nor stumbling over stone or bush. it stopped for a moment now and then to turn aside or to make<br>sure of some dofficulty which needed an outstertched neck, a touch with the muzzle, or a sigh; but<br>otherwise it travelled on slowly but surely through the earlier part of the night, while chris thought till<br>he could think no longer, and began to ride with his shoulders up, his chin in his chest, and a<br>tendency to bow right down his mounts nech. but he never did that once, only clung with a<br>dreamy feeling of safety, with his knees against the saddle flaps and his feet fast in the stirrups. i<br>must not go to sleep, he muttered once; but he did all the same, instinctively tightening his hold by<br>means of his abnormally strained muscles the while. thirty nine. among the hornets. it had been a day<br>of severe exertion mentally and bodily, during which the bags nature had done its best; but the time<br>came at last when it could do no more, and he rode on at that steady walk, sleeping profoundly, so<br>deeply that he did not know when the mustang suddenly stopped shorrt as if in doubt, and stood with<br>ears pointed forward sniffing at the stones beneath its hoof, wrested them to the right and again to<br>the left, as if there was some taint in the air. then the doubt increased, and it bore to the right,<br>stopped, bore to the left again, sniffed more loudly, lowered its head and sniffed again, uttered a low<br>sigh, and resumed its steady walk, on and on, for how long chris never knew, but hours had passed<br>and he was back again in the square hole which griggs termed a trap, listening to what he said about<br>to let the fleet of pirates freely pass, this being the only way to save both the lives of them that came<br>with this petition, as also of those who remained in captivity; all being equally menaced with the sword<br>and gallows, if he granted them not this humble request. but don alonso gave them for answer a sharp<br>reprehension of their cowardice, telling them, if you had been as loyal to your king in hindering the<br>entry of these pirates, as i shall do their going out, you had never caused these troubles, neither to<br>yourselves nor to our whole nation, which hath suffered so much through your pusillanimity. in a<br>word, i shall never grant your request, but shall endeavour to maintain that respect which is due to my<br>king, according to my duty, illustration; morgan dividing the treasure taken at maracaibo page thus<br>the spaniards returned with much consternation, and no hopes of obtaining their requesr, telling<br>captain morgan what answer they had received; his reply was, if don alonso will not let me pass, i will<br>find means how to do it without him. hereupon he presently made a dividend of all they had taken,<br>fearing he might not have an oppurtunity to do it in another place, if any tempest should rise and<br>seperate the ships, as also being jealous that any of the commanders might run away with the best<br>part of the spoil, which then lay much more in one vessel than another. thus they all brought in<br>according to their laws, and declared what they had, first making oath not to conceal the least thing.<br></P>
