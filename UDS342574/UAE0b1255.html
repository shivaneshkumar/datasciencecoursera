<P>whence, all the way down the hill, the place was thronged like a fair when we entered the cove, a<br>musketon was fired at one of the canoes, as we imagined they might be full of men lying down, for<br>they were all afloat, but no one was seen in them. being doubtful whether their retreat proceeded from<br>fear or a desire to decoy us into an ambuscade, we were determined not to be surprised, and therefore,<br>running close in shore, we dropped the grappling near enough to reach them with our guns, but at too<br>great a distance to be under any apprehensions from their treachery. the savages on the little hill kept<br>their ground, hallooing, and making signs for us to land. at these we now took aim, resolving to kill<br>as many of them as our bullets would reach, yet it was some time before we could dislodge them. the<br>first volley did not seem to affect them much, but on the second they began to scramble away as fast<br>as they could , some howling and others limping. we continued to fire as long as we could see the least<br>glimpse of any of them through the bushes. among these were two very robust men, who maintained<br>their ground without moving an inch till they found themselves forsaken by all their companions, and<br>then, disdaining to run, they marched off with great composure and deliberation. one of them, however,<br>got a fall, and either lay there or crawled away on his hands and feet; but the other escaped without<br>any apparent hurt. mr. burney now improved their panic, and, supported by the marines, leaped on<br>shore and pursued the fugitives. we had not advanced far from the water side, on the beach, before we<br>bushes here and there it was a poser. there was a dull streak of sky overhead, in which a star here and<br>there could be seen blinking looking pale. i cont see beyond the ponys head, thought chris why,<br>its madness to try and ride along a place like this; but its horrible to think of sitting here all night,<br>and one couldnt go to sleep. im so hungry too, and oh, i say, whod ever have thought of this what a<br>mess im in there was nothing approaching despair in the boys feelings then, neither was there<br>anything akin to fear, unless it was a dread of being suddenly pounced upon by the indians now. this<br>thought had quite a comic side to it, and he laughed softly. theyd be precious clever ten times as clever<br>as theyre said to be, with their wonderful sight and hearing if they did pounce upon me now, why, look<br>at that it was rather an absurd order which he gave himself as he stretched out his right hand at the<br>level of his eye, for to all intents and purposes there was no hand to look at, while as to his ponys<br>ears, he cerainly knew that they were somewhere in  front, bat that was all. oh, i say, he sighed, i am<br>in a mess, and no mistake if id had any gumption in this thick old head i should have slipped a<br>damper cake in my pocket. but who was going to think of eating at a time like that perhaps ned<br>would, he added with a soft chuckle; and the idea was so mirthful that he shook a little, but only to<br>grow serious directly. there, he said, ive done my duty, im sure, and though im in such a hobble things<br>have turned out capitally, and theyve had plenty of time to get our cliff castle forfeited and stored.<br>that splenndid, and i wont fidget about the indians, for they cant come till to morrow, and perhaps<br>theyll never come at all. but i say, this is coming to search for the old gold city i believe id rather<br>have stopped at the plantation killing blight and scratching the scale insects off the peach twigs. here,<br>they tip us your flipper your mawley your daddle, or your thieving hook; are terms made use of as<br>occasions may suit the company in which they are introduced, to signify a desire to shake hands.<br>approached towards the saint pauls, chiefly occupied in conversation on the great merit displayed in the<br>excellent designs of mr. cruikshank, which embellish the work they had jus been viewing; nor did they<br>discover anything further worthy of notice, till bobs ears were suddenly attracted by a noise somewhat<br>like that of a rattle, and turning sharply round to discover from whence it came, was amused with the<br>sight of several small busts of great men, apparently dancing to the music of a weavers shuttle. what<br>the devil do you call this said he is it an exhibition of wat work. or a model academy neither, replied<br>dashall; this is no other that the shop of a wekk known dealer in stockings and nightcaps, who takes<br>this ingenious mode of making himself popular, and informing the passengers that here you may be<br>served with all patterns and sizes, from the foot to the head, at moderate prices; with woolens for<br>winter, and cottons for summer let us move on, for there generally is a crowd at the door, and there is<br></P>
