<P>was a crispness and revivifying sensation in that gentle evening breeze which seemed to affect even the<br>animals, the ,mules crouching down in the stand and the horses standing facing the quarter from which<br>the wind blew, as if satisfied to wait for the water that they instinctively expected would come. the<br>hour seemed long, and then with a dull star like lanthorn griggs began to pick his way through the<br>transparent darkness, holding the light low in his lookout for enemies, till the end of the rope was<br>found, though not without difficulty, the boys, who led one of the mules between them, having to stop at<br>last and wait till the search came to an end. no snakes about here, said griggs, in a low voice;<br>bring the mule on lads thats right. now then, turn back him a little more. this was done, the rope<br>made fast to the pack saddle, and all was ready. now, said the doctor, will the enemy follow the two<br>kegs or no forward sixteen. saddle naps the start was made in the direction of the spot where the rest<br>of the train was gathered together, and with all present feeling flushed with excitement and indread of<br>what might happen, the rope tightened with a jerk, and then threatened to break, for there was no<br>yielding on the part of the kegs after they had followed for a few yards. the sound announcing that<br>they had caught and became wedged amongst the stones. in the midst of a painful silence griggs said<br>in rather an altered tone well, its of no use to make bones about it. i shall have to go and give em a<br>clearing shove or two youll do no such mad thing, cried the doctor angrily. if the rattlesnakes will face<br>sought some convinient place for landing. to an anchor in the bay of conquet in brittany, near ushant,<br>there to take in water. having stored ourselves with fresh provisions here, we prosecuted our voyage,<br>designing to pass by the ras of fontenau, and not expose ourselves to the sorlingues, fearing the<br>english that were cruising thereabouts. the river ras is of a current very strong and rapid, which,<br>rolling over many rocks, disgorges itself into the sea, on the coast of france, in deg min latitude; so<br>that this passage is very dangerous, all the rocks, as yet, being not thouroghly known. here i shall<br>mention the ceremony, which, at this passage, and some other places, is used by the mariners, and by<br>them called baptism, though it may seem little to our purpose. the masters mate clothed himself with a<br>ridiculous sort of garment, that reached to his feet, and on his head he put a suitable cap, made very<br>burlesque; in his right hand he had a naked wooden sword, and in his left a pot full of ink; his face<br>was horribly blacked with soot, and his neck adorned with a collar of many little pieces of wood thus<br>apparelled, he commanded every one to be called who had never passed through that dangerous place<br>before; and then, causing them to kneel down, he made the sign of the cross on their foreheads, with<br>ink, and gave every one a stroke on the shoulders with his wooden sword. meanwhile, the stranders by<br>cast a bucket of water upon each mans head; and so ended the ceremony but that done, each of the<br>baptized must give a bottle of brandy, placing it nigh the main mast, without speaking a word; even<br>those who have no such liquor not being excused if the vessel never passed that way before, the<br>might happen if he really come, the sight of these war canoes naturally caused us considerable alarm,<br>and we sincerely wished that the visit was over. we dressed ourselves with the utmost expedition, and<br>walked down to the beach. the landing of these warriors was conducted with a considerable degree of order,<br>and could i have divested myself of all ideas of danger i should have admired the sight<br>excessively. all were completely armed their muskets were loaded, their cartouch boxes were fastened<br>round their waists, and their patoo patoos were fixed to their wrists. their hair was tied up in a light<br>knot at the top of their heads, beautifully ornamented with features of the albatross. as the opposite<br>party landed, ours all crouched on the ground, their eyes fixed on their visitors, and perfectly silent.<br>when the debarkation was completed i observed thechief, ta ri ah, put himself at their head, and<br>march towards us with his party formed closely and compactly, and armed with muskets and paddles.<br>when they came very near they suddenly stopped. our party continued still mute, with their firelocks<br>poised ready for use. for the space of a few minutes all was still, each party glaring fiercely on the<br></P>
