<P>neglect of more important consideration, such as odd corners for hide and seek, deep window seats,<br>plenty of cupboards, and a garden adopted to the constuction of bowers rather than to the cultivation<br>of vegetables, i do not think my hopes of influencing the parental decisions were great, but still we all<br>felt that it was well that i should be there, and my inportance swelled with every piece of advice i<br>received from the rest of the party. it must be a biog house, but, of course, that adds to the expense,<br>said one of the older boys, who prided himself upon being more grown up in his views that the rest,<br>and considering the question from the elderly point of view, but if you dont take it out one way, you<br>have it another, he continued, a manly sounding sentence, which impressed us all. dont think about<br>smartness, mary, he went on. with a grand air of renouncing vanities; fine entrance, you know, and<br>front door, but a good back yard, if possible, and some empty outhouses for carpenters shops; and if<br>you could meet with a place with a few old boxes and barrels lying about, for rafts on the river and so<br>forth, it would be a good thing, i want a tidy box for a new baby house, dreadfully, added a sister. i<br>ihope therll be deep window places, sighed the luxurious fatima, with print patchwork cushions, like<br>those at the farm, and i hope some of them will face west, for the sunsets. above all and it was the<br>final and most impressive charge i received whatever else is wanting, let us have two tall trees for a<br>before now, and have come safe out of them, that is true, answered wolfe thoughtfully; and yet a voice<br>in my heart seems to tell me that i shall see those loved faces no more, it may be but the fantasy of a<br>troubled and fevered brain; but in dreams i have seen them, tears in their eyes, weeping for one<br>unworthy of such grief, who lies on a far off grave beneath the frowning battlements of you great city.<br>i wonder oftentimes whether we are given to know something of that which is about to befall; for in my<br>heart a voice has spoken, and that voice has said that quebec shall be ours, but that these eyes shall<br>never see what lies with in the ramparts, for they will be sealed in death before that hour shall arrive.<br>julian. had no reply ready; he knew not what to say. it did indeed seem little likely that that frail from<br>could survive the perils and hardships of this great siege, should it be prosecuted to the end, and<br>should some daring assault be successfully made against the impregnable city. from the day upon<br>which stark arrived in the camp at montmorency with the news from liconderoga wolfe began to mend<br>it seemed as though the certainity that the english arms were prevailing in the west, though no help<br>could be looked for this reason from amherst, combined to put a sort of new viguor and resolution into<br>the heart of the dauntless young general, if anything were to be accomplished, he must now do it by<br>his own unaided efforts; and since august was well nigh past, if he were to act at all it must be soon<br>or the winter storms might come sweeping down, and render his position untenable. he had had plenty<br>of time whilst lying helpless in bed to think out various plans of attack on the city. each one seemed<br>desperate and hopeless, whether, as before, the assault were made by means of boats along the<br>there was an old family bible, a torn copy of culpeppers herbal, the homilies in inexpressibly greasy<br>black calf, a book of songs, a volume called evelina, which seemed chiefly remarkable for dashes and<br>notes of admiration, and the book i chose. the book i chose would look very dull in your eyes, i dare<br>say, my dear ida; you who live in an age of bright, smart story books, with clear type, coloured<br>pictures, and gorgeous outsides. you dont know what small, mean, inartistic cuts enlivened your<br>grandmothers nursery library, that is, when the books, were illustrated at all, you have no idea how<br>very little amusement was blended with the instruction, and how much instruction with the amusement<br>in our playbooks then, and how few there were of them, and how precious those few were you can<br>hardly imagine what a treasure i seemed to have found in a volume which contained several engravings<br>the size of the page, besides many small wood cuts scattered through the letter press. i lost sight alike<br>of fatigue and disappointment, as i pored over the pictures, and read bits here and there. and such<br>charming pictures there were with quaint anglers in steeple crowned hats, setting forth to fish, or <br>breakfasting under a tree untrammelled by the formalities of a nursery meal, or bringling their spoils<br>to a wayside inn with a painted fish upon the sign board, and a hostess in a high hat and a stiff<br></P>
