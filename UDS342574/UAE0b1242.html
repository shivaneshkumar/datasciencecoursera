<P>means i mustnt neglect anything that mite be of use to me; even if theres very little hope of a<br>particular thing being of any use i cant just throw it away. so everything i have ive put to use in my<br>case. ive taken all the money out of nay business, for example, the offices for my business used to<br>occupy nearly a whole floor, but now all i need is a little room at the back where i work with one<br>apprentice. it wasnt just using up the money that caused the difficulty, of course, it was much more to<br>do with me not working at the business as much as i used to.<br>occupy nearly a whole floor, but now all i need is a little room at the back where i work with one<br>apprentice. it wasnt just using up the money that caused the difficulty, of course, it was much more to<br>do with me not working at the business as much as i used to. if you want to do something about your<br>trial you dont have much time fot anything else. so youre also working at the court yourself asked<br>thats just what i want to learn more about. i cant tell you very much about that, said the<br>businessman, at first i tried to do that too but i soon had to give it up again. it wears you out too<br>much, and its really not much use. and it turned out to be quiet impossible to work there yourself and<br>to negotiate, at least for me it was. its a heavy strain there just sitting and waiting. you know<br>yourself what the air is like in those offices. how do you know ive been there. then asked i was in the<br>waiting room myself when you went through. what a coincidence that is exclaimed totally engrossed<br>and forgetting how ridiculous the businessman had seemed to him earlier. so you saw me you were in<br>the waiting room myself when you went through. what a coincidence that is exclaimed totally engrossed<br>and forgetting how ridiculous the businessman had seemed to him earlier. so you saw me you were in<br>the waiting room when i went through. yes, i did go through it one time. it isnt such a big coincidence,<br>said the businessman, im there nearly every day. i expect ill have to go there quite often myself now,<br>said although i can hardly expect to be shown the same respect as i was then. they al stood up for<br>mathematisch zijne zonderlinge reis rondom de wereld volbracht. welk een indruk maakle dit, en welk<br>een ophef in de couranten allen die voor of tegan gewed hadden, of de geheele zaak reeds hadden<br>vergeten, werden als door een tooverroede wakker geschud. alle overeenkomsten werden weder geldig. alle<br>verbintenissen herleefden weer. alle weddenschappen kregen nieuwe kracht, en de phileas fogg actien<br>rezen. de viff medespelers van den gentleman in de reform club brachten deze drie dagen in zekere<br>omust door. die phileas fogg, dien zij allen vergeten hadden, verscheen onverwachts weder voor hunne<br>oogen waar was hij nu den lden december, den dag waarop james strand te edirburg gearresteerd werd,<br>was het z zes en zeventig dagen geleden, dat fogg vertrokken was en men had nog niets van hem<br>vernomen. had hij den stend opgegeven of vervolgde hij zijn weg volgens het overeengekomen reisplan<br>zou hij zaterdag den sten december s avonds ten kwart voor negenen als de geest der nauwgezetheid op<br>den drenpel der reform club verschijnen wij zullen de spanning niet schetsen, waarin ieder engelschman<br>gedurende die drie dagen verkeerde. men zond telegrammen naar amerila en azie, om maar iets van<br>fogg te weten te komen. men ging s morgens en s avonds het huis in saville row, eens opnemen. niets,<br>de politie wist ook niet wat er van den inspecteur fix gewarden was, die zoo angelukkig een verkeerd<br>spoor had gevolgd. dit verhinderde niet, dat men nieuwe weddenschappen op nog grootere school<br>aanging. phileas fogg deelde het lot van het paard, dat aaan de laatste barriere is genaderd. men<br>tallow is made of the beasts which are hereabouts hunted. the inhabitants of this beautiful island of<br>hispaniola often resort in their canoes to the isle of savana, not far distantm where is there chief fishery,<br>especially of tortoises. hither those fish constantly resort in great multitudes, at certain seasons, there<br>to lay their eggs, burying them in the sands of the shoal, where, by the heat of the sun, which in<br>those parts is very ardent, they are hatched. this island of savana has little or nothing that is worthy<br>consideration, being so very barren by reason of its sandy soil. true it is, that here grows some small<br>quantity of lignum sanctum. or guaiacum, of whose use we say something in another place, westward<br>of santo domingo is another great village callled el pueblo de aso, or the town of aso: the inhabitants<br>thereof drive great traffic with those of another village, in the very middle of the island, and is called<br>san juan de goave, or st. john of goave. this is environed with a magnificent prospect of gardens,<br>woods, and meadows, its territory extends above twenty leagues in length, and grazes a great number<br>of wild bills and cows. in this village scarce dwel any others than hunters and butchers, who flay the<br>beasts that are killed. these are for the most part a mongrel sort of people; some of which are born of<br>white eurpoean people and negroes, and
