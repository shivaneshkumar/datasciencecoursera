<P>if he could not understand the italian at first, he would be able to very soon, and even if he really<br>could not understand very much he said it was not so bad, as it was really not so important for the<br>italian to be understood. and anyway, k.s knowledge of italian was surprisingly good, the director was<br>sure he would get by very well. and with that, it was tome for to go. he spent the time still remaining<br>to him with a dictionary, copying out obscure words he would need to guide the italian round the<br>cathedral. it was an extremely irksome task, servitors brought him the male, bank staff came with<br>various queries and, when they saw that was busy, stood by the door and did not go away until he<br>had listened to them, the deputy director did not miss the oppurtunity to disturb and came in<br>frequently, look the dictionary from his hand and flicked through its pages, clearly for no purpose,<br>when the door to the ante room opened even clients would appear from the half darkness and bow<br>timidly to him they wanted to attract his attention but were not sure whether he had seen them all this<br>activity was circling around with him at its centre while he compiled the list of words he would need,<br>then looked them up in the dictionary, then wrote them out, then practised their pronounciation and<br>finally tried to learn them by heart. the good intentions he had  had earlier, though, seemed to have<br>left him completely, it was the italian who had caused him all his effort and sometimes he became so<br>angry with him that he buried the dictionary under some papers firmly intending to do no more<br>preparation, but then he realized under some papers firmly intending to do no more<br>preparation, but then he realised he could not walk up and down in the cathedral with the italian<br>were such a lot of them to shoot, though, said chris, and the birds were all quite together, i say, ned,<br>look at this arrow. gone right through the neck. think theyll come back to look for more, father no,<br>was the reply. i can just see them under the sun riding right away we might go on now slowly if we<br>keys in the thick grass. the word given, and all mounted, but not until griggs had followed the<br>indians example of tying the two birds legs together and swinging them across his saddle bow, chriss<br>proposal to carry his own capture being negatived on the declaration that it would be much easier for<br>two to be carried together than one. youll ger your supper after all, ned, said chris, after they had<br>been riding slowly on through than one. youll get your supper after all, ned, said chris, after they had<br>been riding slowly on through the grass as near to trail as could be guessed, for it was still<br>considered advisable to keep as much under cover as possible the indians sense of sight being well<br>known to be very acute. there, you neednt try to joke about that, was the reply, in a weary, querulous<br>tone. youre as fond of good things as i am. never said i wasnt, cried chris, laughing. but i say, griggs,<br>we must have one of those for supper to night, no matter how late we are. all right, said the american.<br>i begin to feel as if i can pick a bit myself; but you wont like raw turkey, will you haw nonsense we<br>must make a good fire, and frizzle bits over the embers. a good fire, to show the indians where weve<br>made our camp oh exclaimed chris. i never thought of that, and he was silent for a few minutes, but<br>only to break out again with, we shall be too far off for any indians to see, for weve got many miles<br>to go yet to camp. and we can make our fire in the shelter of the trees, added ned. thatll be all right.<br>better known by the appelation of rag fair. it is a general mart for the sale of second hand clothes,<br>and many a well looking man in london is indebted to his occasional rambles in this quarter for his<br>appearance. the business of this place is conducted with great regularity, and the dealers and collectors<br>of old clothes meet at a certain hour of the afternoon to make sales and exchanges, so that it is<br>managed almost upon the same plan as the royal exchange, only that the dealers here come loaded<br>with their goods, which must undergo inspection before sales can be effected: while the merchant carries<br>with him merely a sample, or directs his purchaser to the warehouse where his cargo is deposited. the<br>principal inhabitants of this place are jews. and they obtain supplies from the numerous ilinerant<br>collectors from all quarters of london and its suburbs, whom you must have observed parading the<br>streets from the earliest hour of the morning, crying ould clothes clothes sale. it surely can hardly be a<br>trade worth following, said talltho. there are many hundreds daily wandering the streets, however,<br>replied tom, in pursuit of cast off apparel, rags, and metals of different sorts, or at least pretend so,<br>the jews are altogether a set of traders. i do not mean to conifine my observations to them only<br></P>
