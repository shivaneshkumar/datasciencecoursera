<P>well knowing that it was contrary to the wish of all the white settlers that they should proceed to<br>hostilities indeed, europeans intrepidly mingled amongst them, urging them to a reconcilation, and<br>threatening that, if they failed in their endeavours, the supplies of arms and ammunition should be<br>discontinued this. threat had its desired effect on the minds of the natives; no blood was split, and each<br>chief returned quietly to his own home on the aright we heard of the death of george and his wife,<br>revenge and war was the universal cry. his party would not believe that it could be an accident, nor<br>would they hear of any apology being received at this time they imagined the tribes of hokianga were<br>possessed of but very few firearms; and as the skirmish took place in that place in that district, it was determined<br>that an exterminating war should be carried into the heart of it. however, before al the preparations<b>could be made to carry their intentions into effect, they received certain information that the people of<br>hokianaga were even better supplied with muskets than those of the bay of islands. this intelligence<br>occasioned an assemblage of the different; tribes to be proposed, and when it took place the friends of<br>george saw their opponents so well prepared for the tug of war that they deemed it judicious to come<br>forward and to shake hands and to acknowledge that the death of shulitea proceeded either from<br>accident or mistake a curious circumstance took place in the midst of their debate an old chief, who<br>wished for a fight, and did not approve of the introduction of firearms, but was an advocate for the old<br>method of new zealand warfare, proposed that each party should send away all their muskets and<br>to which chris new sprang, to stand looking about him of course, he said. we must have climbed up<br>here to what father called the; tableland, and somewhere farther on, i suppose, we should come to the<br>edge of the cliff and look down into the valley with the openings facing one. but not now, he said, with<br>a shudder, as thought of the perpendicular character of the opening faces. yes, thats all clear now; the<br>indians must have come along here while i was going along the gulch, and soon after i had passed<br>they got down and turned the other way, making for the valley, and getting in perhaps before my<br>people has secured all the stores and things. oh, what have i done he cried bitterly. failed horribly<br>failed now how am i to find out what has happened since has there been a terrible flght can i go down<br>now and see no no no, come three dreary answers. part of the indians may be down there by the built<br>up cliff; the others will be coming back soon; and what could i do in this darkness, with it far darker<br>in the valley if i only knew what has happened since he said, with a groan full of despair, as,<br>dropping down upon the soft turf half sitting, half kneeling he gazed in the direction where he<br>supposed the great hollow to be, listened to the crop crop crop of the grazing beast, and wondered how<br>long it would be before the daylight came. it was long and weary time, for there was no sleepy<br>sensation noe, chris had had his first taste of a very real danger. he could not hide from himself the<br>knowledge that he had been quite near the end of all his bright, hopeful aspirations. the chase after<br >him had been so savage that he had no faith in being made a well treated prisoner. the indians had<br>men and women, young and old, who get mere by their pretended distresses in one day than many<br>industrious and painstaking tradesman or mechanics do in a week. all the miseries, all the pains of<br>life, with tears that ought to be their honest and invariable signals, can be and are counterfeited limbs,<br>which enjoy the fair proportion of nature, are distorted, to work upon humanity fits are feigned and<br>wounds manufactured rags, and other appearances of the most squalid and object poverty, are as the best engines of<br>deceit, to procure riches to the idle and debauncheries to the infamous. ideal<br>objects of commiseration are undoubtedly to be met with, though rarely to be foung it requires a being<br>hackneyed in the ways of men, or having at least some knowledge of the town, to be able to<br>discriminate the party deserving of benevolence; but a begging they will go will go will go, and a begging they<br>ill go. the chief cause assigned by some for the innumerable classes of mendicants that infest our<br>streers, is a sort of innate priciple of independence and love of liberty. however, it must be apparent<br>that they do not like to work, and to beg they are not ashamed; they are, with very few exceptions,<br>lazy and impudent. and then what is collected from the humane but deluded passengers is of course<br></P>
