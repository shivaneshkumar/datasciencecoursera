<P>break open my portmanteau; and one old wretch sharpened his knife, and made motions as though he<br>were going to cut my throat and eat me. i knew my only chance of safety was not to betray any sign<br>of apprehension; so i forced a laugh, and made them believe i considered their tricks an excellent joke.<br>i gave them all my tobacco to keep them in good humour; but i passed a most miserable night, nearly<br>suffocated with smoke, distracted with their noise, and annoyed by vermin of every description, i was<br>most happy when daybreak gave me an excuse for leaving these brutal savages, and resuming my<br>journey. every step i took brought before me proofs of the horrors of war: villages which had been<br>crowded, were now entirely desolate, and in many instances burned to the ground on that spot where had left a<br>party of enterprising scolchmen busily employed in sawing timber, with crowds of natives<br>assisting them, all was quiet and totally deserted, with the expectation of a few nearly starved, wrethched<br>looking dogs, who, hearing someone approach, came out, and tried to bark at us, but were too weak to<br>utter a sound. chapter l. european preparations for defence. our march along the banks of the river was<br>through a most beautiful country; but all the inhabitants had fled; their plantations were in a most<br>luxuriant state; fields which i had left bare and uncultivated were now covered with indian corn standing<br>higher than my head, the ripe ears hanging fantastically in all directions, and none to gether in the<br>harvest; the crops of kumara and potatoes were equally abundant. i could not help thinking that, if<br>listening, while the next minute as the reverberation grew louder, a spasm, half joy, half fear, ran<br>through him as, like a flash, the familiar figure of the american glanced in the sunshine, disappeared<br>in the shade, and came into sight again, with head down, fists doubled and held close to his breast, as<br>he came running rapidly along the bottom of the gulch. the next minute he had reached the narrow<br>chasm above which chris and his friends lay waiting, disappeared, and the inclination that nearly<br>carried chris away was to spring up, shout words of encouragement, and then clamber to where he<br>could follow the swift runner with his eyes till he went out of sight at some turn of the gulch on his<br>way to the valley. but the orders were to lie close till the whistle rang out, and like the rest, who were<br>influenced by the same feeling, chris crouched lower to gaze right away in the old direction, listening<br>with straining nerves to the ever nearing echoing beat of horses hoofs, till about a couple of hundred<br>yards away a mounted indian, bow and arrow in one hand, rein in the other, bounded into sight,<br>urging on his pony with voice and hand, will he know that it is a trap thought chris, and he fully<br>expected to see the man draw rein, send an arrow amongst the hiding party, and gallop off but even<br>as the thought ran through the lads brain the savage reached the narrow gap and dashed through by<br>this time two more were close behind, a party of four some fifty yards in the rear, all galloping hard,<br>eager to overtake the fugitive, while as they passed through at full gallop the echoes of the hoofs<br>increased for a mob of about thirty came into sight, all tearing along as in a race, and passed<br>repaid monthly or weekly, as the case may be, otherwise they forfeit all claim to this aid the<br>portugese jews are generally opulent and respectable, and hold no community with the others, they<br>use a different liturgy, and their language is even different. they never intermarry with the jews of the<br>dutch synagogue. they pride themselves on their ancestry, and give their children the best education<br>which can be obtained where they reside. the brolers upon the exchange, of the jewish persuasion, are<br>all or chiefly of the portuguese synagogue. their number is limited to twelve by act of parliament, and<br>they pay guineas each for this privilege. they had noe reached the end of houndsditch, when, passing<br>through bishopsgate church yard and broad street, they were soon at the bank. this building, said<br>dashall, covers an extent of several acres of ground, and is completely isolated, its exterior, replied bob,<br>is not unsuited to the nature of the establishment, as it certainly conveys an idea of strength and<br>security thats true, continued lom; but you may observe a want of uniformity of design and<br>proportion, arising from its having been erected piece meal, at different periods, and according to<br>different plans, by several architects. this is the principal entrance; and opposite to it is the shortest<br>street in the metropolis, called bank street; it contains but one house. now we will take a survey of the<br></P>
