<P>of salmon, which they shot and spread as they glided in shoals over the yellow sands. it was after<br>scooping a wounded fish fron the swift waters that chris afterwards took the tin hanging from his belt<br>and stood knee deep to fill the vessel with the cleat  cold water fresh from the mountains. hand me a<br>tinful, cried ned, who stood aloof so as not to wet his buffalo skin boots. it was boy like, chris filled<br>the tin, and giving griggs a merry look, scooped it half full of sand as well, i say, it feels precious<br>heavy cried ned, as he raised it to his lips. yah he shouted, and he was about to loss the contents<br>back over the giver, but griggs caught him by the arm. ill drink that, he said; im not afraid of a little<br>sand. he drank till the sand touched his lips, and then held it in the sunshine, looking into the tin,<br>stooped and refilled it, and rinsed it round, to pour away a mixture of sand and water, refilled again,<br>and repeated and repeated till nearly all the sand has gone; and then he held out the cup in triumph,<br>for the others to see a few glistening pieces of yelloe metal about as big as small, smooth, flattened<br>shot. gold he cried. now then, all we have to do is to follow up this river into the mountains the<br>golden city is there. and they followed that river for weeks, living upon the salmon, and washing for<br>gold fromt ime to time, and rarely without finding a few tiny nuggets, while the river grew more<br>narrow, more rugged, more difficult of access, and drove tham at last into cutting off curves and<br>eyes were going round like flaming catherine wheels, but there are certain requests which one has not<br>the option of refusing. tommy crept nearer, and put his lips to the round face out of which the eyes<br>shone. ah it was so downy and warm, sa soft, so indescribingly soft. tonrmys lips sank into it, and<br>couldnt get to the bottom. it was unfathomable features and fluffiness. now, what do you want said the<br>owl. please, said tommy, who fekt rather re assured, car you tell me where to find the brownies,<br>and how to get one to come and live with us oohoo said the owl, thats it is it t know of three brownies<br>hurrah said tommy. where do they live in your house, said the owl. tammy was aghast. in our house<br>he exclaimed. whereabouts let me rummage them out. why do they do nothing one of them is too<br>young, said the owl, but why dont the others work asked tommy. they are idle, they are idle, said the<br>old owl , and she gave herself such a shake as she said it, that the fluff went flying through the shed,<br>and tommy nearly tumbled off the beam in his fright. then we dont want them, said he. what is the use<br>of having brownies if they do nothing to help us perhaps they dont know how, as no one has told<br>them, said the owl. i wish you would tell me where to find them, said tommy i could tell them. could<br>you said the owl. i wish you would tell me where to find them, said tommy i could tell them. could<br>you said the owl. oohoo oohoo and tommy couldnt tell whether she were hooting or laughing. of course<br>i could, be said. they might be up and sweep the house, and light the fire, and spread the table, and<br>that sort of thing, before father came down besided they could see what was wanted the brownies did<br>all tha in grannys mothers young days and then they could tidy the room, and fetch the turf, and<br>pick up any chips, and sort grannys scraps. oh theres lots to do. so there is, said the owl. oohoo well, a small<br>portmanteau and to serve me as a guide. as on my former journey, we travelled many miles<br>through thick tangled forests, fatiguing beyond description. in the midst of our toilsome progress,<br>night frequently overtook us then, by means of my fowling piece, i procured a light, the boy made a<br>fire, and we passed the night in this vast wilderness, far from the habitation of any human being at<br>daybreak we resumed our journey, and at length about ten o clock we emerged from the wood, and<br>entered upon extensive plains. these were not naked deserts, similar to the ones i had passed through<br>on my former route, but were diversified with bush and brake, with a number of small villages scattered<br>in various directions. at mid day we arrived at what in new zealand is considered a town of great size<br>and importance, called ly a my. it is situated on the sides of a beautiful hill, the top surmounted by a<br>pa, in the midst of a lonely and extensive plain, covered with plantations of indian corn, kumara and<br>potatoes, this is the principal inland settlement, and, in point of quiet beauty and fertility, it equalled<br>any place i had ever seen in the various countries i have visited. its situation brought forcibly to my<br>remembrance the scenery around canterbury. we found the village totally deserted, all the inhabitants<br>being employed in their various plantations; they shouted to us as we passed, thus bidding us welcome,<br></P>
