<P>to carry a letter over to you, although that is strictly contrary to our orders. i expressed a desire to<br>know what he meant by a warm piece; he kicked his foot against the stock of a gun i had at the time<br>in my hand; and, looking at me with an expression of the greatest contempt, said, it is what you<br>wordly folks call a musket they were making considerable preparations to repair to the great meeting<br>of the chiefs, to which rivers was journeying, this was a wise and politic measure for them to pursue;<br>and they were highly delighted to have such an addition to their party as this well known chief; and<br>though they were highly delighted to have such an addition to their party as this well known chief; and<br>though they would not acknowledge it, their satisfaction was very visible. i earnestly requested them to<br>inform me candidly, from all they had heard, whether they thought i might, with safety, venture across<br>the country; but i could get nothing from them but vague and mysterious answers: one thing, however,<br>they made me very clearly understand; which was, that they neither cared for me nor for my drawings;<br>that their own safety engrossed all their thoughts; and that a worldly minded, misguided creature like<br>me was but as dust in the balance, compared to such godly people as themselves, who were now placed<br>in jeopardy. they, without scruple, applied quotations from the scriptures to themselves, such  as, why<br>do the heathen so furiously rage, etc., etc. my necessities compelled to me to request a favour from them,<br>which was, that they would allow one of their boys, who could speak english, to accompany me, as our<br>loads were heavy; and his being known to belong to their establishment i thought might be some<br>him his friends were watching and waiting as he felt must be the case to fire at the first indian who<br>showed himself above the top of the cliff. chris so low and distant, but so clear. chris ahoy coo ee<br>shouted the boy downward, and from between his hands. this time there was no answering yell, and<br>chris listened to the words that come up, sending a thrill of joy through him, but at the same time a<br>strange tremor of fear can you hear came now yes then listen, came with very slow emphasis. you<br>must creep gully lower self down. chris was silent as he sat staring down as it seemed into nothing but<br>the clear air, for the stone to which he had clung projected from the cliff face, just as the parts above<br>him overhung as if about to fall. hear came from below. the single word was so sharp and inperative<br>that the boy replied at once, shouting the one word, cant and then, as if ashamed of himself for so<br>shrinking a reply, he alluded to one only of the dangers which hemmed him in by crying out, indians<br>chriss heart leaped again, and hope grew brighter, for he more fully grasped his situation from the<br>next words that came, through he had pretty well understood it before. dare not show. but the words<br>had hardly been uttered before chris felt that he knew more than his friends, for his strained and<br>wandering eyes, which shrank from gazing down into the awful depths below, suddenly became aware of<br>a slight movement amongst the pensile growth between the summit and the spot form which the indians<br>had shot at him. he was in doubt for a few moments, and he held his breath as he cautiously brought<br>his rifle to bear upon the hanging bush. but it did not stir, and it seemed evident that he had only<br>curious creatures, the one who favoured us with a good view of him being very like a loose red velvet<br>pincushion with eight legs, and most of th bran let out. yet this strange, unshapely creature has a,<br>distinct brain in a soft kind of skull, mandibles like a parrot, and plenty of sense. his sight, hearing,<br>touch, taste, and smell are acute. he lies kicking his legs in the doorway of his favourite cavern, which<br>he selected for himseld and is attached to, for a provokingly long time before he will come out. when he<br>does appear, a subdued gran of gratified exception runs through the crowd in front of his window,<br>as head over heels, hand over hand, he sprawls downwards, and moves quickly away with the peculiar<br>gait induced by having suckers instead of feet to walk with. tank contains eels. it seems to be a<br>curious fact that fresh water eels will live in sea water. i should think, when they have once got used to<br>the salt. they must find a pond very tasteless afterwards. they are night feeders, as school boys know,<br>well. tank fish grey mullet. tank prawns. if with the fishes we had felt with friends, and with the<br>lobsters as if with hobgoblins, with the prawns we seemed to find ourselves among ghosts, a tank that<br>seems only a pool for a cattle fish, or a cod is a vast region where prawns and shrimps are the<br>inhabitants. the caves look huge and would hold an army of them. the rocks jut boldly out, and throw<br></P>
