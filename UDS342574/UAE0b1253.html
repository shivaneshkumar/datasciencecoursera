and as, during the time they are out, the greater part of the crew are baling<br>the water out of them, they thought the leaky state of our vessel was no uncommon occurence. but<br>however cheerfully they worked during the day, nothing could induce them to turn out at night; they<br>always stowed themselves away, but in what part of the vessel i never could conjecture. they have a<br>dread of some unknown evil spirit, which they imagine has power over them at night. and this<br>supposition makes them terrible cowards in the dark. the second day after we were at sea, i saw a<br>group of savages lying round the binnacle, all intently occupied in observing the phenomenonon of the<br>magnetic attraction; they seemed at once to comprehend the purpose to which it was applied, and i<br>listened with eager curiosity to their remarks upon it. this, said they, is the white mans god, who<br>directs them safely to different countries, and then can guide them home again. out of comliment to<br>us, and respect for its wonderful powers, they seemed much inclined to worship this silent little monitor.<br>during our voyage to port jackson we experienced a succession of southerly gales, which captain kent<br>informed me were veryprevalent at this season of the year. notwithstanding all our exertions to prevent<br>to blow it out before joining at the rope and hauling the searcher to the platform. what is it, sir cried<br>griggs anxiously come and see, was the reply. the doctor made his way through the hole and crossed<br>the chamber into which it opened, before entering the next, closely followed by the boys and griggs,<br>who caught up their rifles as they passed them, dragging the ropes as they went. as they entered the<br>second chamber it was to see the doctor join bourne at the window opening, while beyond them stood<br>wilton sheltering himself behind a patch of bushy growth hanging from above, as he stood watching<br>something intently through the doctorss double glass. see any more, wilton said the doctor anxiously.<br>scores, was the reply, given without the speaker turning his head. you can see for yourself;

but they have caught sight of something else. what cried<br>griggs. ah you there said wilton sharply. you had better come and have a look through this glass;<br>you may be able to tell what race they are perhaps, said griggs shortly; but what is it they can see<br>the ponies and mules. are you sure yes; there was one of the men, a chief apparently, pointing down at<br>them. i could see it plainly through the glass. indians, ned, whispered chris. they must have been<br>following us all this time, and were in for it now. thirty eigth. besieged not a word was said then for<br>some minutes, daring which the glass was passed from one to the other, and long, excited looks taken<br>the son. i then held up three, intimating, that i believed in father, son, and holy ghost. he then<br>clenched his fist, and, looking sternly at me, signified, that these three are one;
