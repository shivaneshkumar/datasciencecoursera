<P>carried back to rivers was very important. i did not mention to anyone the hiding of these muskets in<br>the woods, though, according to the articles of war, i ought to have done so, as getting possession of<br>them would have added two more to our strength, and lessened that of our enemy; my silence arose<br>from a repugnance i felt to betray these poor creatures, who had behaved so well to me. although<br>prepared for war, we were very well pleased to find no attack was made upon us. indeed, from the first,<br>it had been my decided opinion, that unless we interfered, and made ourselves by that means they had too much<br>respect for us, and were too anxious to retain our kindly feelings towards them, to<br>molest us; at the same time, i felt that it might be a very politic measure to shoe them what powerful<br>resistance we could make, if driven to extremities. after passing a week of the greatest anxiety, on<br>account of our expected invasion, it offered us the utmost satisfaction to receive a visit from mr. hobbs, the western missionary, one of the persons who had visited the war camp of the assembled<br>chiefs, who were convened, on the death of our lamented friend george, to debate and decide upon the<br>momentous question of peace or war. the subject our informant stated had been gone into at great<br>length, and stormy and fierce had been the discussion. finally, the good sense of the elder and more<br>experienced chiefs prevailed over the fiercer passions of the younger, and peace was decided upon, this<br>event forms a new era in the political history of the few zealanders, it being the first time so great an<br>assemblage had met to discuss openly a national question, or in which they had allowed cool reasoning<br>galloping after me as hard as they can come, not that it will be very fas, for mounted men cant get<br>along very well among rocks and trees. whats more, they cant shoot straight with their ponies<br>cantering. i dont believe theres a bi of risk for me. i shall be all right. whatim afraid of is that when<br>i came along through the narrows with the whole herd full pelt after me, some of the mules and ponies<br>will squeal or neigh, and make the enemy suspicious. if they do hear anyhing, were done. but our<br>animals will be well back in that hollow, said chris. yes, my lad; but i want them to be planted farther<br>back still. theres a bit ive been looking out quite a quarter of a mile farther off, and im going to<br>propose it to the doctor as being safest. im afraid father will say that the ponies ought to be close at<br>hand. yes, thats right, if it can be done; but it would go hard with us all if the indians gave up the<br>bait of the trap and turned upon those who set it. we mustnt run risks if theres a way of doing things<br>more safely. well, you must talk it over with father, said chris. lets see; were going to have another<br>look at the place this afternoon, arent we we were, replied the american; but were not going now, why<br>too many redskins about, as i told you. there are always too many redskins about, cried chris<br>impatiently. i wish we could charge them boldly, and send them flying over the plains. never to come<br>back again, said ned sharply. yes, that would be very nice, my lads, replied griggs; but it will not do<br>o be impatient, im patient cried ned. weve been patient enough. not quite, my lads. dont you see that<br>were playing a very ticklish game the plan is to get out of this valley ourselves, where we are<br>regularly locked in, and to put the redskins in our place, locking them in, it would be rather<br>remarkable if it wasnt a ticklish job. just then the doctor came into the shelter where the boys had<br>the shape of the land, in some manner resembling a great sea tortoise, called by them tortuga de mar.<br>the country is very mountainous, and full of rocks, and yet thick of lofty trees, that grew upon the<br>hardest of those rocks, without partaking of a softer soil. hence it comes that their roots, for the<br>greatest port, are seen naked, entangled among the rocks like the branching of ivy against our walk.<br>that port of this island which stretches to the north is totally uninhabited; the reason is, first, because<br>it is incommodious, and unhealthy; and, secondly, for the ruggedness of the coast, that gives no access<br>to the share, unless among rocks almost inaccessible: for this cause it is peopled only on the south<br> part, which hath only one port indifferently good: yet this harbour has two entries, or channels, which<br>afford passage to ships of seventy guns; the port itself being without danger, and capable of receiving<br>a great number of vessel. the inhabited parts, of which the first is called the low lands, or low<br>country: this is the chief among the rest, because it contains the port aforesaid. the town is called<br></P>
