<P>that can convert the world; we have the lords own word for that. if you have read in any tongue his<br>last charge an earth to his, apostles, as recorded in the gospal of st.john, you must see and recognize<br>that, the burden of that wonderful pastoral is, that all may be one: that the world may believe, to<br>rend the body is to destroy its unity, to destroy its, unity is to binder the work of christ upon earth.<br>think and ponder that well, and pray for guidance, for patience, for the submissive will which would<br>endure much rather than bring war amongst the members. of the one body, our lord himself has, those who are<br>devout and sincere from the error of straining at a grat ab swalloing a camel. let the<br>church minister the word of god. let those who hunget for more ask of her. she will not send them<br>empthy way, already those who style themselves, reformers are quarrelling amongst themselves. soon<br>they will be broken up into a thousand camps, unity will cease to reign in the church, confusion and<br>hatred and even bloodshed will follow, be advised, anthony dalaber. quit these hard and vexed<br>for a while. take to the less perilous study of the law. with age and experience you will learn your<br>lesson, and i will pray for a blessing upon you, my son, for in truth i believe that the lord may have<br>work for you to do in days, to come; and if so, i trow you will not shrink from doing it. anthony stood<br>mute, a thousand questions and replies seemed to spring to his lips, but no word passed them. he left<br>has had the truth withheld from him long enough, now he shall have the oppurtunity to know the<br>truth and woe into those who have falsely taught in his, name, great temples of stone are not<br>necessary in the eyes, of the great one. his, truth is revealed in the hearts, of men. many have been the<br>great masters who, have trod the earth, each has, brought great teachings, of truth, but the darkness<br>has bidden these truths, therefore, let he who has, eyes, to see and be who has, ears, let him hear and<br>know the truths, it shall not be found in the great temples, hut in the heart of man. know ye not that<br>ye are the temple of creation i give a message to those of earth: open your hearts and receive this<br>great light which is, being given to you at this time, yea, i say unto you. man needs, but to open his<br>and receive the glory of the one great being, he need only be touched by this, light to awaken in<br>him great revelation; to bring about a degree of understanding that will put him in a path of great<br>magnitude, great learning, great wisdom and understanding, beloved children of the light, open your<br>hearts that this, river of light might flow to, you and raise you to heights, far, far beyond that you can<br>now conceive of your love should so rediate that those about you feel you love and light whenever they<br>are near you. this, creates, more desire in those with whom you come in contact, more desire to know<br>this, truth than anything you do, that is, what is ,meant by the statement in your holy works, which<br>states , do not hide your light under a bushel, but let your light shine forth that others, might see it<br>this,light radiates from you when you are able to demonstrate it in your own life, because your life is<br>corner with ambitious, eyes, till one day there came upon me the desire to learn russian. i asked my<br>father for a russian grammar, and he pointed out the only one that he possessed, my father seldom<br>refused to lend us. his books, and made no inquires as to why we wanted them; but he was intensely<br>strict about their proper treatment, so that we early learnt to turn over leaves from the top, to avoid<br>dogs ears, and generally to treat books properly and put them away punctually, thus i got the<br>grammar, and carried it off to the swing, alas, it was not even russian and english, which was, of some<br>assistance, and set myself resoulutely to learn the alphabet, but my progress, was, slow, and at last i<br>got my father to write reka dom for me in russian character, as i had determined to master these few,<br>letters, first and then proceed, i soon became familiar with them, and was, not a little proud of the<br>achievement. i made a large copy to, fasten upon the nursery wall; i wrote it in all my books; and<br>fatima, who could not be induced to attack the fat grammar with me, became equally absorbed on her<br>part in the effort to reduce the inscription to cross stitch fot the benefit of her sampler, i borrowed the<br>fat grammar again. and, in spite of my fathers, warnings, that it was, too difficult for me as, yet, i<br>hoped soon to be proficient in the language of the little russians,. but warnings, from ones, elders, are<br></p>
