<P>themselves. but as there are many hogs and dogs roaming at large through their villages, they are<br>very careful to fence their dwellings round with wicker work, to preserve them from the depredations of<br>these animal; and as the houses are extremely low, they have very much the appearance of bird cages<br>or rabbit hutches. their storehouses are generally placed upon poles, a few feet from the ground, and<br>tabooed or consecrated great taste and ingenuity are displayed in carving and ornamenting these<br>depositories. i made drawings from several of them, which were entirely covered with carving; and<br>good attempts at groups of figures, as large as life, plainly showed the dawning of the art of sclupture<br>amongst them. many of the attempts of the new zealanders in that art are quite as good, if not better,<br>than various specimens i have seen of the first efforts of the early egyptians, painting and sclupture<br>are both arts greatly admired by these rude people. every house of consequence is ornamental and<br>embellished, and their canoes have the most minute and elaborate workmanship bestowed upon them<br>their food is always eaten out of little baskets, rudely woven of green flax; and as they generally leave<br>some for their next meal, they hang these baskets on sticks or props, till they are ready to eat again.<br>thus a village presents a very singular appearance, as it is stuck full of sticks, with various kinds of<br>baskets hanging from them. this plan, however, is the most rational that could be adopted, as none of<br>their eatables can be left on the ground, or they would become the prey of the hogs and dogs. in the<br>here with the door open. only the enemy were afraid to come. then you think we could find a way up<br>there said chris, shading his eyes and looking across the valley at the perpendicular sunlit cliff full of<br>window or door openings similar to those from which they gazed. im beginning to think we could, my<br>lad. what do you say to going across and having a search yes; lets go at once, cried chris. arent you<br>too stiff stiff no. come along at that moment ned, who had been staring hard at the opposite terraces,<br>suddenly caught griggs by the arm, grigging it sharply. whats the matter keep quiet dont move, said<br>the boy in a whisper, though no one could have heard from the spot at which he looked, theres<br>something moving about on that top terrace across yonder. a bear said chris eagerly. perhaps no: its<br>standing up now, well, bears do that sometimes. its so far off. i cant quite make out, said ned<br>excitedly. ah theres another and another. why, there are six or seven crawling about yonder. then<br>theyre not likely to be bears, said griggs. wheres your glass up in the lookout. ill go and fetch it. yes,<br>and be smart, cried griggs. then, as the boy hurried away to climb up to the watching place i wont<br>give any alarm yet till were quite sure. but if its the enemy theyve some game on there, and theres<br>going to be more sharp shooting. chris, my lad, theres no doubt about it now. theres a way down from<br>the top of the cliff to that top terrace yonder, and that means there must be a way up to it from<br>below. your plans cutting two ways. its giving us a way to get clear enemy, and showing us<br>that weve been in greater danger than we thoughr for. now see what you can make out. your eyes are<br>lading wood: hereupan they sent six of their men to watch them, who next morning, by a wile,<br>possessed themselves of the canoes. having given notice to their companions, they boarded them, and<br>also took the little man of war, their convoy. being thus masters of this fleet, they wanted only<br>provisions. of which they found little aboard those vessels: but this defect was supplied by the horses,<br>which they killed, and salted with salt, which by good fortune the wood cutters had brought with them,<br>with which they supported themselves till they could get better. they took also another ship going from<br>new spain to moracaibo, laden with divers sorts of merchandise and pieces of eight, designed to buy<br>cocoa nuts for their lading home: all these they carried to jamaica, where they safely arrived, and,<br>according to custom, wasted all in a few days in laverns, giving themselves to all manner of<br>debouchery. such of these pirated will spend two or three thousand pieces of eight in a night, not<br>leaving themselves a good shirt to wear in the morning. my own master would buy sometimes a pipe of<br>wine, and, placing it in the street, would force those that passed by to drink with him, threatening also<br>to pistol them if they would not. he would do the like with barrels of beer or ale; and very often he<br>would throw these liquors about the streets, and wet peoples clothes without regarding whether he<br></P>
