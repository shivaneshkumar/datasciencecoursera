<P>an ait of such calm, confident power that the y were deeply impressed; and one of them; looking<br>earnestly at him, cried; you make us admire you as much as we fear you, monsieur wolfe. but if you<br>are to have quebec, pray take it quickly; for this long, cruel war wears us out. madame, he answered, i<br>would that i could; but monsieur de montcalm gives me no chance of fighting. if he were not so<br>cautious, i should greatly rejoice. i give him all sorts of chances to attack me, but he will not avail<br>himself of them. if caution could save quebec, annuredly it would never fall if he take not care, his<br>caution will be his undoing, said a canadian dame of springhtly turn, as for us of the country, we are<br>weary to death of uncertainity. they tell me that the canadian militia will not long remain loyal if kept<br>in such inactivity. we canadians do not understand this sort of warfare. quick raids, sharp fighting,<br>quick return home is what our men are used to. they can be brave enough in their native forests; but<br>this sitting down in camps for weeks and months together, whilst their harvests are lying uncut in the<br>fields. or left a prey to indian marauders no, that they do nat understand or appreciate. they are<br>almost ready to welcome english rule sooner than go on like this. i doubt not you have heard as much<br>from your prisoners before, something like it, answered wolfe, with a slight curl of the lip. i confess i<br>have no great opinion of the militia of monsieur de montcalm. his regular troops are fine soldiers; but<br>stimulates the mental faculties. dorothy said, i always thought that color was jus plain color, plain<br>and simple. i didnt know that each color had a different effect on you, there is a great deal that is not<br>known, said princess saari. at least, not known to the general public; you see, throughout hostory,<br>there are those who have been knowledgeable on certain subjects; subjects which are generally not<br>taught. not too long ago these people were burned at the stake by these people do not say too much, as they know that<br>much of what they might say would not be accepted. however, for one such as yourself who has an<br>open and curious mind, books are available on these subjects and can be found. the scarecrow,<br>interceded, we discussed this recently, didnt we, dorothy yes, we did, said dorothy. we all had quite a<br>discussion on the subject of knowledge and truth and books what was the general consensus asked the<br>princess. well, that we should not accept blindly that which adults teach us, but that we should sift<br>and question and think for ourselves. and if we should become confused by conflicting ideas, said the tin woodman, we<br>should meditate on the subject and ask the great wizard to give us the truth or to guide us in the<br>right direction. do u know, who the great wizard is asked princess saari. i was telling dorothy<br>something about him, said the tin woodman, but couldnt quite explain how it is that he loves everyone<br>even the wicked witch. wel, ill be happy to explain a little more about him, said princess saari<br>inscription in that language, it was curious, and then interesting, and then the quaint simple little of<br>the house took his fancy besides this, though he could not but allow that there was reason in my<br>mothers views on the subject of large grounds in combination with one man of all work, he liked plenty<br>of space and shrubbery where he could wonder about his hands behind his back without being<br>disturbed; and for his own part he had undoubtedly felt more pleasure in the possession of large<br>grounds than annoyance at seeing them neglected. so the garden tempted him. finally, there was a<br>room opening upon a laurel walk, which had at one time been a library. the shelves old, common, dirty<br>and broken were still there, and on the most secure of them the housekeeper kept her cheese and<br>candles, and an old shawl and bonnet. the place is made for us i exclaimed on my return from<br>discovering the old barrel and tea chests. my father was standing in the library looking out upon the<br>garden, and he did not say no. from the old woman we learnt something of the farmer tenants. she was<br>a good natured old soul, with an aggrived tone of voice, due probably to the depressing effects of<br>keeping an empty house for a cantankerous landlord. the former tenants name was smith, she said<br>unmistakably english this, but his lady was a roosian, she believed. they had lived in roosia, and some<br>of the children, having been born there, were little roosians, and had roosian names. she could not<br>
