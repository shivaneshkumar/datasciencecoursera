<P>can it mean facy or faced smoothly the church raising was always a great event in the town. each<br>citizen was forced by law to take part in or contribute to raring the meeting hows, in early days nails<br>were scarce, so scarce that unprinciled persons set fire to any buldings which chanced to be<br>temporarily empty, for the sake of obtaining the nails from the ruins; so each male inhabitant<br>supplied to the new church a certain amount of nayles. not only were logs, and lumber, and the use of<br>horses and mens lobor given, but a contribution was also levied for the inevitable barrel of rum and its<br>unintoxicating accompaniments. rhum  and cacks are frequent entries in the account books of early<br>churches. no wonder that accidents were frequent, and that men fell from the scaffolding and were<br>killed, as at the raising of the dunstable meeting house. when the medford people built their second<br>meeting house, they provided for the workmen and bystanders, five barrels of rum, one barrel of good<br>brown sugar, a box of fine lemons, and two loaves of sugar, as a natural consequence, two thirds of<br>the frame fell, and many were injured. in northampton, in, ten gallons of rum were bought for s for<br>setting ebenezer burts thy which had somehow through the rum or the raising, bith gotten broken.<br>must creep gully lower self down. chris was silent as he sat staring down as it seemed into nothing but<br>the clear air, for the stone to which he had clung projected from the cliff face, just as the parts above<br>him overhung as if about to fall. hear came from below the single word was so sharp and imperative<br>that the boy replied  at once, shouting the one word, cant and then, as if ashamed of himself for so<br>shrinking a reply, he alluded to alluded to one only of the dangers which hemmed him in by cryin out, indians<br>chriss heart leaped again, and hope grew brrighter, for he more fully grasped his situation from the<br>next words that come, through he had pretty well understood it before. dare not show. but the words<br>had hardly been uttered before chris felt that he knew more than his friends, for his strained and<br>wandering eyes, which shrank from gazing down into the awful depths below, suddenly became aware of<br>a slight movement amongst the pensile growth between the summit and the spot from which the indians<br>had shot at him. he was in doubt for a few moments, and he held his breath as he cautiously brought<br>his rifle to bear upon the hanging bush. but it did not stir, and it seemed evident that he had only<br>imagined the danger. he had held his breath painfully while he watched, and now, feeling that he was<br>wrong, and must say something to those below, he breathed again freely and was about to speak when<br>his heart seemed to stand still again, for one swinging bough was slightly agitated and pressed aside,<br>him twelve hundred men, five boats laden with artillery, and thirty two canoes. the first day they sailed<br>only six leagued, and came to a place called de los bracos. here a party of his men went ashore, only<br>to sleep and stretch their limbs, being almost crippled with lying too much crowded in the boats.<br>having rested awhile, they went abroad to seek victuals in the neighbouring plantations; but they could<br>find none, the spaniards being fled, and carrying with them all they had. this day, being the first of<br>their journey, they had such scarcity of victuals, as the greatest part were forced to pass with only a<br>pipe of tobacco, without any other refreshment. next day, about evening, they came to a place called<br>cruz de juan gallego. here they were compelled to leave their boats and canoes, the river being very dry<br>for want of rain, and many trees having fallen into it. the guides told them, that, about two leagues<br>farther, the country would be very good to continue the journey by land. hereupon they left one<br>hundred and sixty men on board the boats, to defend them, that they might serve for a refuge in<br>necessity. next morning, being the third day, they all went ashore, except those who were to keep the<br>boats. to these captain morgan gave order, under great penalties, that no man, on any pretext<br>whatever, should dare to leave the boats, and go ashore; fearing lest they should be surprised by an<br>ambuscade of spaniards in the neighbouring woods, which appeared so thick as to seem almost<br>impenetrable, this morning beginning their march, the ways proved so bad, that captain morgan<br>thought it more convenient to transport same of the men in canoes though with great labour to a place<br>farther up the river, called cedro bueno. thus they re embarked, and the canoes returned for the rest, so<br></P>
