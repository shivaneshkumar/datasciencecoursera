<P>the natives, in hopes of finding something new for my pencil in their peculiar and picturesque style of<br>life. i left them with opinions, in many respects, very favourable towards them. it is true, they are<br>cunning and over reaching in trade, and filthy in their persons. in regard to the farmer, we europeans,<br>i fear, set them a bad example; of the latter, they will gradually amend. our short visit to kororarika<br>greatly improved them in that particular. all took great pains to come as clean as possible when they<br>attended our evening tea parties. in my opinion, their sprightly, free, and independent deportment,<br>together with their kindness and attention to strangers, compensates for many defects, on looking<br>round upon their country, an englishman cannot fail to feel gratified when he beholds the good already<br>resulting to these poor savages from their intercourse with his countrymen; and they themselves are<br>fully sensible of, and truly grateful for, every mark of kindness manifested towards them. they have<br>stores full of the finest indian corn, which they consider a great luxury, a food which requires little<br>trouble iin preparing, keeps well, and is very nutritious. it is but a few years since this useful grain<br>was introduced amongst them; and i sincerely hope this introduction may be followed up, not only by<br>our sending out to them seeds of vegetables and fruits, but by our forwarding to them every variety of<br>quadruped which can be used for food abundance of the finest water melons are daily brought<br>alongside vessels entering their ports; these, in point of flavour, are superior to any i ever met with. i<br>have no doubt every variety of european produce essential to the support of life would thrive equally<br>open country beyond was before him, he was bending down again to reach forward and pat the ponys<br>neck, shouting cheering words to it the while, when he suddenly became aware of the fact that right in<br>front , and coming from quite a different direction, there was another party of the enemy, which no<br>sooner caught sight of the chase than they increased their pace, spreading out into a line the while.<br>chris began to draw rein, slowly checking his ponys gallop to a canter, and then easing it down to a<br>walk, for he had been graduallu edged more and more towards the rim of the great depression, till<br>there was not more than a hundred yards between him and the precipitous descent, which presented an<br>effectual barrier to all escape there. theyre too much for me, panted the boy breathlessly, and quite<br>innocent of this naive way of expressing himself a mere lad, against nearly, a hundred of the active<br>warriors of the plain. but im not done yet, he muttered, as he pressed his ponys sides and cantered on<br>towards where in one spot the smooth level gave place to a rugged patch where the ground was broken<br>up and strewed with stones right to the edge of the precipice for about a hundred yards, before it<br>became smooth and level again, as near as he could guess he was leaving behind the spot where the<br>indians had been first seen; but that was only a passing thought. he was, as he had said, not done<br>yet, and in those stones he saw shelter for himself and his mount while he made a stand for a time in<br>the hope that aid of some kind might come, or some turn of the tide occur in his favour. full of this<br>idea, he cantered on, and reached the rugged patch of broken ground, his sinking spirits rising as he<br>universal silence prevailed, but an uproar of approbation followed, which lasted for some minutes, with<br>a general call of encore, which however soon subsided, and the company was again restored to their<br>former state of conversation; each party appearing distinct, indulged in such observations and remarks<br>as were most suitable or agreeable to themselves. bob was highly pleased with this description of a<br>milling match; and as the singer was sitting near the person who had excited a considerable portion of<br>his attention at intervals in watching his tricks, in some of which great ingenuity was displayed, he<br>asked his cousin if he knew him. know him, replied tom, to be sure i do; that is no other than billon,<br>a well known pugilist, who frequently exhibits at the fives court; he is a jew, and employs his time in<br>giving lessons. zounds said mortimer, he seems to have studied the art of legerdemain as well as the<br>science of milling, he is an old customer here, said a little gentleman at the opposite side of the table,<br>drawing from his pocket a box of segars now, sir, i continued he, if you wish for a treat, addressing<br>himself to tallyho, allow me to select you one there, sir, is asgar like a mosegay i had it from a friend<br></P>
