<P>excitedly, anywhere, sir, except into the soda plains, the thing youve got to do is to put as many miles<br>between you and here as you can manage in the next twenty four hours. what, and desert you cried<br>bourne. how are you going to manage to find us oh, ill find you by your trail when the time comes,<br>sirm said griggs, laughing. dont you be afraid of that. dont even think about it, only of getting right<br>away. i see, said the doctor, and he frowned down chris, who was about to speak. now go on. theres<br>not much more to say, sir. we shall stay here till dusk, giving the redskins a reminder now and then<br>that were on the alert; and at last, when we feel that theyre coming on for the attack, into the saddles<br>we jump and steal off till were out of bearing, and then crawl till we make sure of the trail of the<br>mules, and then gallop. hut the ponies will have gone with the mules, cried chris excitedly. youd better<br>not let them, said griggs, with a grim smile at the boy. youve got to see the train started well on its<br>way from the bottom of the gully, and then bring the horses here all six, mind. yes, i see, said chris,<br>brightening up, the sun seeming to come out on his gloomy, powdre smirched face. but what about<br>neds and mr bournes ponies theyll have to be contented with mules. theyve only got to walk, and there<br>avenue of drums, dolls, trumpets, accordians, workboxes, and what not; but what oclock it was when i<br>came out at the other end, with a schilling and same coppers in my pocket, and was cheered, i cant say,<br>though i should like to have been able to be accurate about the time, beacuse of what followed. i<br>thought the best thing i could do was to get out of the fair at once, so i went up the village and<br>struck off across some fields into a little wood that lay near. a favourite walk in old times. as i turned<br>out of the booth, my foot struck against one of the yellow sticks of the climbing monkeys. the monkey<br>was gone, and the stick broken it set me thinking as i walkeed along. what an untold number of pretty<br>and ingenious things one does not wear out in honourable wear and tear, but utterly lose, and wilfully<br>destroy, in ones young days things that would have given pleasure to so many more young eyes, if<br>they had been kept a little longer things that one would so value in later years, if some of them had<br>survived the dissipating and destructive days of nurserydom. i recalled a young lady i knew, whose<br>room was adorned with knick knacks of a kind i had often envied, they were not plaster figures, old<br>china, wax work flowers under glass, or ordinary arnaments of any kind. they were her old toys.<br>perhaps she had not had many of them, and had been the more careful of those she had. she had<br>certainly been very fond of them, and had kept more of them than any one i ever knew. a faded doll<br>slept in its cradle at the foot of her bed a wooden elephant stood on the dressing table, and a poodle<br>that had lost his nark put out a red flannel tongue with guixotic violence at a windmill on the sleep,<br>while the ponies seemed to follow their masters like dogs, ready to accept every pat on the neck<br>or word of encouragement, and after raising their muzzles to the offered hard and looking through the<br>darkness appealingly, as if asking how long it would be before they come to water. morning at last. a<br>halt, packs lowered to the ground, each animals mouth washed out with about a pint of the precious<br>fluid water, and then their ration given in the form of very stiff gruel. all this carefylly done before the<br>breakfast was attacked i dont call it a breakfast, grumbled ned. no, i wouldnt, said chris. cheer up; we<br>havent so far to go now as we had yesterday morning. well, i know that, snarled ned, who seemed all<br>on edge. chris called it gritty, and said it was the sand to himself he gets it on his temper, thought<br>the boy. how queer it is that being hot and tired and thirsty makes any one so cross forward said the<br>doctor at last, when the packs had been readjusted; and the dreary tramp began again, with the sun<br>getting hotter and hotter every hour. oh dear groaned ned, as they tramped side by side, each with his<br>hand resting apon his ponys neck and holding on by the mare. that misreable tinful of water why, it<br>was only half a pint, and it will be hours before were allowed any more. why not kt us have a pint all<br>at once against the rules,said chris. you should have made believe, as i did. believe what no, i didnt<br>believe it, said chris; i only played at it. i drank my half pint very slowly, and pretended it was a pint.<br>you do the same the next time. not going to be such a fool, said ned gruffly. its all too real to play.<br>bother hang it yah i wish there wasnt a scrap of gold in the world. but there is, all the sane. come,<br></P>
