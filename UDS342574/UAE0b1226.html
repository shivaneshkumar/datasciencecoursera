<P>joint stock made altogether a respectable appearance. we proceeded to be puna in two whaleboats: it<br>was a most delightful trip, the scenery being strikingly beautiful. the village of ranghe hue, belonging<br>to warri pork, is situated on the summit of an immense and abrupt hill: the huts belonging to the<br>savages appeared, in many places, as though they were overhanging the sea, the height being<br>with a mighty pah, at the bottom of this hill, and in a beautiful valley, the cottages of the crowned<br>missionaries are situated, complete pictures of english comfort, content, and prosperity: they are close<br>to a bright sandy beach: a beautiful green slope lies in their rear, and a clear and never failing stream<br>of water runs by the side of their enclosures. as the boats approached this lovely spot, i was in an<br>ecstasy of daylight: such a happy mixture of savage and civilized life i had never seen before; and when i<br>observed the while smoke curling out of the chimneys of my countrymen, u anticipated the joyful<br>surprise, the hearty welcome, the smiling faces, and old christmas compliments that were going to take<br>place. and the great pleasure it would give our secluded countrymen to meet us, in these distant<br>regions, at this happy season, and talk of our relatives and friends in england. my romantic notions<br>were soon crushed; our boats approached the shore, they walked away to their own dwellings, closed their<br>abundant growth, owing to the moisture beneath the little dry river bed having kept the coarse grasses<br>pretty succulent. there was the hum of mosquitoes and the boom of big beetles, and every now and the cry and<br>answering cry of some animal unknown from out in the sage brush. but for a time the lads<br>lay silent, till a peculiar mournful shout, as it seemed to be, came from the direction of the lagoon,<br>sounding so mournful and human that it was too much for ned, who whispered awake, chris of course.<br>whos to go to sleep with millions of things getting up your legs and arms and down your neck. i wish<br>id taken off my clothes. isnt it hot yes, yes; but did you hear that yes. what was it owl , said chris then<br>shortly. i know it was a howl, said ned, but it was more like a shoat or hail. owl, owl, hunting about<br>over the brush forr young hares or rats and mice. oh, of course. i never thought of that, said ned, and<br>he settled down quietly for a few minutes, before saying in a whisper: i say, isnt il queer that one<br>seems to hear hundreds of things now, that one never noticed at home i dont know perhaps we should<br>have heard some of these ticks and squeaks and rustlings if we had lain awake. i say, ned, i believe all<br>the wild things from round about are coming to see what we want here. very likely whats that what<br>that flask of light, is it a storm coming pooh no. father threw some bits of dry stuff on the fire, to be<br>sure. but i say, chris, thats why all these insects and things come creeping up.. its the light that<br>somewhere about here with pearls still in them. ive seen shells sometimes looking quite pearly inside<br>though theyve been buried in rock no end of time. you didnt hear your father say only day before<br>yesterday that all this salt desert land must at one time heve been the bottom of the sea. what do you<br>say to that oh said chris thoughtfully, and ned pushed his broad leaved hat a little on one side so as<br>to scratch his ear. youre right, though, after all, about lions and tigers, and so was only theyre<br>american lions and tigers puma and jaguars, and pumas without any means, and jaguars with spots<br>instead of stripes. wait a bit, and we shall come upon some of them. not here, though; its not likely<br>sort of country for them, but theres mountain land yonder piled up higher than we shall be able to<br>take our mustangs and mules. we shall find watercourses soon, and that means trees and grass and<br>quite a different climate. the sort of place where were quite likely to find uncle ephraim at home. what,<br>grizzly bear cried chris excitedly. thats the gentleman, replied griggs; and as like as not after crossing<br>a ridge or two we may come upon buffalo. what, in the mountains perhaps. more likely in the plains.<br>there, dont you chaps grumble any more. your fathers have got quite enough to think about without<br>having to talk to you about being a little more pluncky and patient.yes. i know, cried chris, wincing;<br>were only grumbling to you. oh, then i dont matter not a bit. youre such a good tempered, patient<br>chap, and you seem like one of us. but i say, griggs, do you really think we are going to find a change<br>in the country soon certain. oh come, thats better we have had enough of sand and sage brush,<br></P>
