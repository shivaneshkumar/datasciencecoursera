<P>office into that of the director, he was glad come into the office so early was able to be of service<br>immediately, nobody could seriously have expected that of him. the deputy directors office was,<br>of course, still as empty as the middle of the night, the servitor had probably been asked to simmon<br>him too but without success as entered the reception room two men stood up from the deep armchairs<br>where they had been sittng. the director gave him a friendly smile, he was clearly very glad that was<br>there, he immediately introduced him to the italian who shook k.s hand vigorously and joked that<br>somebody was an early riser. did not quite understand whim he had in mind, it was moreover an odd<br>expression to use and it took a little while to guess its meaning. he replied with a few bland phrases<br>which the italian received once more with a laugh, passing his hand nervously and repeatedly over his<br>blue grey, bushy moustache. this moustache was obviously perfumed, it was almost tempting to come<br>close to it and sniff. when they had all sat down and began a light preliminary conversation, was<br>disconcerted to notice that he understood no more than fragments of what the italian said. when he<br>spoke very calmly he understood almost everything, but that was very infrequent, mostly the words<br>gushed from his mouth and he seemed to be enjoying himself so much his head shook. when he was<br>talking in this way his speech was usually wrapped up in some kind of dialect which seemed to to have<br>nothing to do with italian but whuch the director not only understood but also spoke, although ought<br>he had hoped he might find himself, and that was not far from opposite the piece of terraced diff where<br>he hoped that his friends might be. he went at once to the pony and led it with him, now moving very<br>cautiously for fear of danger, towards the edge of the cliff in the hope that as it grew lighter some one<br>might catch sight of him and wave him a signal that he might take as a piece of advice. but it was<br>still dark below, and he knew the folly of expecting to see any one looking up to where he stood,<br>feeling in his heart that it was far more likely that they might be lying in wait for his return far<br>away towards the entrance of the gully, ready to cover his retreat if he made an attempt to rush in.<br>but i cant, he said to himself dolefully its impossible to get down there. he wanted to get close to the<br>edge of the cliff to stand above the ranges of cells, facing those they had explored; but it was still too<br>dark, for he knew not what rifts or precipitous places might score the tableland upon which he stood;<br>and the day was coming so slowly. while he grew more impatient minute by minute. there were<br>moments when he thought it would be unwise to expose himself on the top, for if there were indians in<in>the depression looking sharply about, according to their nature, he would be showing where they could<br>stand a better chance of hunting him down in the full light of day. but if they did attempt such a<br>thing he began wondering whether it would be possible to lead them a long chase, gradually working<br>round till he could make a dash for the gulch and so join his friends. he could not help feeling that<br>there was little likelihood of this. and then his attention was taken up by the strengthning of the<br>is arrested, and gone to a look up shop, a place of mere accomodation for gentlemen to take up their<br>abodes, for the purpose of arranging their affairs, and where they can uninterruptedly make up their<br>minds whether to give bail, put in appearance and defend the suit, or take a trip to abbotts priory;<br>become a three months student in the college of art, and undergo the fashionable ceremony of white<br>washing. i begin to understand you now, said bob, and the only difference between our two friends is,<br>that one has willingly put on a chain for life and the other may in all pobability continued tom, have<br>to chaff his time away with a chum perhaps not quite so agreeable, though it really is possible to be<br>very comfortable, if a man  can reconcile himself to the loss of liberty, even in durance vile, by this time<br>they were walking leisurely along piccadilly, and marching without any cumbersome load, they markd<br>every singular slight on the road. who is that meagre looking man and wadding woman, who just<br>passed us inquired tallyho. an old bencher, was. the reply; there you see all that is left of a man of<br>haut ton, one who has moved in the highest circles; but alas bad company and bad play have reduced<br>him to what he now is he has cut up and turnd down very well among the usurers and attornies; but it<br>is impossible to say of him, as of his sirlain of a wife for she cannot be called a rib, or at all events a<br></P>
