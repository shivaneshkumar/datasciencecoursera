<P>carefully covered over and left to start a second blaze at the nooning. covered again during<br>the afternoon service, and kindled up still a third time to warm the chilled worshippers ere they started<br>their cold ride home in the winter twilight. and when the horses were saddled, or were harnessed and<br>hitched into the great box sleighs or pungs, and when the good puritans were well wrapped up, the<br>dying coals were raked out for safety and the noon house was left as quiet and as cold as the deserted<br>meeting house until the followingg sabbath or lecture day, if the meeting house chanced to stand in the<br>middle of the town as was the universal custom in the earliest colonial days of course a noon house<br>would be rarely bait, fot it would plainly not be needed nor was a sabba day house always seen in<br>more lonely situations, if the sanctuary were placed near the substantial farm house of a hospitable<br>farmer; for to that friendly shelter the whole congregation would at noon time repair and absorb to the<br>fullest degree the welcome cider and warmth. in lexington for many years after the revolutionary war,<br>the winter church goers who came from any distance spent the nooning at the dudley lavern, where a<br>roaring fire was built in the inn parlor, and there the women and children are their midday lunch. the<br>men gathered in the bar room and drank flip, and ate the taverrn gingerbread and cheese, and talked<br>over the horrors and glories of the war. in haverhill, derby, and many other towns, the school house,<br>matter of the exploration chris led with his companion, and griggs followed next, as if he were their<br>henchman, while the three friends came last. the ascents were made with spirit till all stood in the<br>chamber at the back of which the opening led into the side of the square pit, and here, while the<br>doctor thoughtfully turned over and examined some of the remains still left, griggs lit the lanthorn he<br>had brought, and ned tied one end of a hide rope to it, ready for the lowering down, while chris had<br>stopped through the hole and stood on the broad ledge at the foot of the rough projections in the stone<br>wall that acted as steps, it must have been awful, he said aloud suddenly, as he stood peering up<br>through the twilight at the restains of the piled up stones at the top what must have been awful asked<br>wiltin, stepping out to his side. why, that fight when the indians climbed up these steps, wuth the other<br>people raining down big stones on their heads. think it was so said wilton quietly. i feel sure of it. my<br>word never mind about them being horribly savage know brave they must have been why, i felt regularly<br>shaky at having to get up yonder with no enemy to face. yes, its an ugly place, said wilton; but what<br>about enemies down below can you see anything no, said chris, smiling queerly. rattlers. ugh if there<br>are any we shall see them when the lanthorns swung down. why, it will be a good bit of sport for you<br>to have a shot at them. the horrible beasts said wilton. were ready when you are, said griggs from the<br>door and returned with a new importation by this time, the gig having been discharged of its cargo,<br>was reascended by the master and his man, and bowld off again ub gay style for the futrher<br>accomodation of fashionable friends, whose society was in such high see bum trap, page estimation<br>that no excuse ot denial could avail, and who being sa urgently wanted, must come. tis a happy age<br>we live in, said merry well; the improvements are evident enough; every thing is done with so much<br>facility and genlility, that even the race of bailiffs are transformed from frightful and ferocious looking<br>persons to the most dashing, polite and accomodating characters in the world, he however, like<br>others, must have his assistant, and occasional substitute. a man in this happy era is really of no use<br>whatever to himself. it is a principle on which every bocy, that is any body, acts, that no one should<br>do any thing for himself, if he can procure another to do it for him. accordingly, there is hardly the<br>most simple performance in nature for the more easy execution of which an operator or machine of<br>some kind or other is not employed or invented; and a man who has had the misfortune to lose, or<br>chuses not to use any of his limbs or senses, may meet with people ready to perform all their functions<br>for him, from paring his nails and cutting his corns, to forming an opinion. no man cleans his own<br>teeth who can offord to pay a dentist; and hundreds get their livelihood by shaving the chins and<br></P>
