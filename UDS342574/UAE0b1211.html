<P>here that shoe going clipitty clop, clippity clop, suddenly, dorothy became  aware of several adult<br>octapony gathering on each side of them as they walked, the tin woodman said, perhaps. we should<br>walk a little faster, as they did, the octapong walked faster, too and each foot with the shoe came<br>down in unison to make a deafening crash on the ground, as dorothys group walked faster and faster,<br>so did the octapong, until everyone was running like the wind. suddenly they all came to a screeching<br>halt as, a huge brick wall loaned up in front of them, the brick wall stretched for miles right across<br>octapongland. there was, no way anyone could escape. so roared one of the octopong. be appeared to<br>their leader, thought you could get way, eh no one escapes the octapong. you see, my dears, with the<br>help of our trapping wall here, and our little system of running you into it, we are guaranteed a fresh<br>supply of shoes every time anyone crosses, our land, noow off with your shoes, be shouted youre just a<br>bunch of thieves said dorothy angrily. were not thieves, said the leader of the octapong. are we, boys<br>no they all called out together, there, said their leader, you see well what do you call it said dorothy.<br>taking peoples, property without theit consent lets, call it a toll far the use of our land, you dont<br>have any signs posted, said dorothy. so that makes it stealing, in beginnig to lose my patience with you,<br>little girl, said the leader, now give me your shoes, you too, be said to the scarecrow, now look here,<br>the master, it now directs the person life, he or she has, lost control, and is now a slave to this new<br>master, it now directs the persons life, he or she has, lost control, and is now a slave to this new<br>master, not only that, some of these chemicals can affect the brain in such a way as, to cause the<br>person to do, awful things to other people, or to themselves. at the very least their personality becomes<br>distorted: they can have terrible mood swings, and their natural drive and creative ability severely<br>diminished, sometimes seizures, or even death can occur, cant anyone stop all this said the<br>girrephalump. why do people make these chemicals, and sell them for money, said dorothy. they love<br>money so much, they dont care who gets, hurt, thank goodness i dont have to live in your mortal lands,<br>said the girrephalump, well, its not all bad, said dorothy. there are many kind and wonderful people<br>there like aunt em and uncle henry, its . just the few that spoil things, for many, it still seems to me<br>that the place to start is with little children. said the girrephalump. if mortals. were taught<br>kindness, and love and gentleness and understanding, and all of these things as, children the same things.<br>their, by the time they grew up, all the bad adulrs, would have died off. im afraid its not that simple<br>said dorothy. some parents, are full of hate and resentment, or show contempt for other races, or creeds<br>by the way they talk,this all influences the children, why cant the schools teach the children<br>differently im sure they do their best, said dorothy, but they are busy teaching reading, writing and<br>had no wish to arrive weary and travel stained at the kings, court, orders, had been given for every man<br>to don his, best riding dress, and look well to the trappings of his steed, and it was a gallant looking<br>company indeed that sallied out from the door of the wayside hostelry and took the road towards the<br>great castle, glimpses of which began from time to time to be visible through the trees i trow, they<br>would scarce know us, there be moments, raymond, when i scarce know, myself for the same. itseems as<br>though years had passed since we left the old home, and by the mass i feel as though i were a new,<br>being since then yea, verily, and i also, answered raymond, looking round him with eager eyes. gaston,<br>look well about thee; for by what malcolm says, these very woods through which we shall pass, and<br>the manor of old winds or hard by, are the property of our uncle sir john de brocas, the kings, master of<br>the horse; and by what i hear, methinks we shall see him in the flesh ere the day has passed ha<br>exclaimed gaston, with interest; if that be so let us, heed him well, for much of our future may hang on<br>him. he is in the kings, favour, they say, and if he did but plead our cause with the roy outremer, we<br>might well look to call basildene our home ere long, we must call him no longer the roy outremer, said<br>raymond, with a smile, if we are to be the brothers of basildene, we must be english subjects and he<br>our liege lord,  true, answered gaston readily; and methinks, if he be what all men say, it will be no<br>hardship to own ourselves his, subjects, i would ten thousand times, sooner call myself so than be<br>
