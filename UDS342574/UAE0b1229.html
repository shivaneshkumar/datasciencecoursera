<P>the birds. well, well, my children; to know and love a wood truly, it may be that one must live in it as<br>i have done; and then a lifetime will scarcely reveal all its beauties or exhaust its lesson. but even<br>then, one must have eyes that see, and ears that hear, or one misses a good deal, it was in the wood<br>that i heard this strory that i shall tell you. how, did you hear it asked the children. a thrush sang it<br>to me one night one night said the children, then you mean a nightingale. i mean a thrush, said the<br>old man. do i not know the note of one bird from another i tell you that pine tree by my cottage has a<br>legend of its own, and the topmost branch is haunted. must all legends be about the loves and sorrows<br>of our self satisfied race alone but did you really and truly hear it they asked i heard it, said the old<br>man. but, as i tell you, one hears and one hears. i dont say that everybody would have heard it,<br>merely by sleeping in my chamber; but for the benefit of the least imaginative, i will assure you that<br>it is founded on fact. begin begin shouted the children. once upon a time, said the old man, there was a<br>young thrush, who was born in that beautiful dingle where we last planted the fern. his home nest was<br>close to the ground, but the lower one is, the less fear of falling; and in woods, the elevation at which<br>you sleep is a matter of taste, and not of expense or genliilty. he awake to life when the wood was<br>dressed in the pale fresh green of early summer; and believing, like other folk, that his own home was<br>meeting house which showed off well, and was a proper source of evny to the neighboring villages and<br>the country around. the studiously remote and painfully inaccessible locations chosen for the site of<br>many fine, roomy churches must astonish any observing traveller on the byroads of new england. too<br>often, alas these churches must astonish any observing traveller on the byroads of new england. too<br>often, alas these churches are deserted, falling down, unopened from year to year, destitute alike of<br>minister and congregation. sometimes, too, on high hilltops, or on lonesome roads leading through a<br>tall second growth of woods, deserted and neglected old graveyards the most lonely and forlorn of all<br>sad places by their broken and fallen headstones, which surround a half filleed in and uncovered cellar,<br>show that once a meeting house for new england christians had stood there. tall grass, and a tangle of<br>blackberry brambles cover the forgotten graves, and perhaps a spire of orange tiger lilies, a shrub of<br>southernwood or of winter killed and dying box, may struggle feebly for life under the shadow of the<br>plumed ranks of tall wild cherry, and prove that once these lonely graves were cared for and loved for<br>the sake of those who lie buried in this now waste spot. no traces remain of the old meeting house save<br>the cellar and the narrow stone steps, sadly leading nowhere, which once were pressed by the feel of the<br>children of the pilgrims, but now are trodden only by the curious and infrequent passer by the feel of the<br>children of the pilgrims, but now are trodden only by the curious and infrequent passer by, or the<br>epitaph seeking antiquary. it is difficult often to understand the details in the descriptions of these<br>early meeting houses, the colonial spelling is so widely varied, and so cleverly ingenious, uniformity<br>of spelling is a strictly modern accomplishment, a hampering innovation. a square roofe without dormans,<br>with two lucoms on each side, means, i think, without dormer windows, and with luthern windows.<br>indians can lower themselves down over the edge of the cliff no, father; not umless they are ready to<br>drop as i did. how far cant tell said chris, with an involuntary shudder, it was rather horrible, and i<br>wonder i wasnt killed and i wonder too, said the doctor solemnly, i dont think that they will dare to<br>descend in the daytime, for they will be afraid that we are waiting to fire at all whoshow; so come on.<br>are you sure you can walk, griggs walk, sir i should like to run, but your leg must smart. hardly<br>smarts, sir; its just as if somebody was playing at sewing it up with a red hot skewer. nice bold<br>refreshing sort of pain. lchah thats all right. but where are the mules and ponies, father said chris, as<br>they hurried now in the direction of the terraced cliff on their right. hobbled, and grazing at the foot of<br>our cliff under shelter of a couple of riffles. but there ate more indians at the mouth of the gulch i dont<br>know, said the doctor. they had a fire burning there last night yes, said chris dryly, i know; but he<br>did not then attempt to explain how he knew, they havent shown since they felt the effect of our<br>bullets, but they are as cunning as they are treacherous, and one never knows what they may be about.<br>some quarter of an hour later the adventurers were all in shelter, one of the cell of the lower range<br>having been turned into a temporary mess room, while the next showed signs of cooking in the shape<br></P>
