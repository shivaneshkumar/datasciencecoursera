<P>strategic triumph for us, even though we do not reap immediate fruit from it. and if once amherst can<br>march to join us, it will be everything to have skipping in the upper river, and you are hopeful that he<br>will if he can make good his, position upon the lakes, and in the west. i have information that things<br>are going well for us there; but so far no definite news, of the capture of ticonderoga has, reached us. it<br>is rumoured that niagara is attacked, and is likely to pass into our bands, there is no doubt that the<br>french all along the western boundary are in extremity, if quebec goes, all will go; they will have no<br>heart to hold out. but, on the other hand, if we are beaten here, and are forced to retreat<br>unsuccessfully, it will have a great moral effect throughout canada. canada is becoming vey half<br>hearted towards its french masters,. said moncton. we hear a good deal from prisoners brought to the<br>camp by scouts. we had one brought in the other day a cunning old rascal, but by no means<br>relicent when we had plied him with port wine. he said that they were sick to death of the struggle,<br>and only wished it over one way or the other, they would be glad enough to stand neutral, and serve<br>either french or english according as, the victory went; but their priests, threaten them with spiritual<br>terrors if they do not fight for the cause of holy crunch as they term it, whilst the military authorities<br>urchin in the curb; of seasoned seniority chiding the heedlessness of the stripling of twenty two. cant<br>you see  that my beast wants water blue jeans was deeply offended. such opulence in anyone at such a<br>moment would have seemed a needless taunt; that chance had selected the superintendent to flaunt it<br>was surplusage of insult. yet he could not even resent the superintendents gesture, wide flung and<br>arrogant to all beholders, again the superintendent looked to have the right of it.he clicked to gril a<br>mine and she came to him, out of the way, like an obedient puppy. and then began the performance<br>for the benefit of the car windows, and which the car windows enjoyed. this picturesque son of the real<br>west, this colorful figure in new chaps and new shirt and thirty dollar hal, tried to ride his horse up to<br>the tub. and the horse would not go. in the first place the horse was not thirsty; in the second place,<br>like girl a mine, he was exceedingly afraid. yet in the beginning, when the dee&jee superintendent<br>scratched him with a solid silver spurs by the way of comforting him, he merely rose on his hing legs,<br>but no nearer the tank. at any other time the superintendent, who was not an unusual fool, would have<br>doone the wiser thing; he would have dismounted and led his animal. but now, even though he might<br>have bested his own vanity in spite of the car windows, blue jeans would not permit it, blue jeans had<br>been quick to see where this might lead and spoke with malicious calculation, i thought your horse<br>these houses, we cant live on the river banks, i wish we could, i sighted; and though he had risen and<br>turned away, i lingered still. at this moment my father exclaimed bless my soul and i jumped up and<br>turned round. he was staring at a wall with a gateway in it, enclosing a house and garden on the<br>other side of the road. on the two gateposts were printed in black roman letters two words that i could<br>not understand reka dom. what does it mean i asked. reka dom said my father thoughtfully and he<br>pronounced it rayka dome. it is russian. it means river house, very curious, i suppose the people who<br>live here are russians. its a nice situation a lovely view, lovely and he had turned round to the river, but<br>i caught his arm. father, dear, no one lives here. look and i pointed to a board beyond the gateway,<br>which stated in plain english that the house was to let. by the time that we returned to my mother,<br>reka dome was to all intents and purposes our home. it is true that the house was old, rambling, and<br>out of repair, and that what we heard of the landlord was not encouraging. he was rich, we were told,<br>but muserly; and a very queer old gentleman, whose addness almost amounted to insanity. he had made<br>himself so unpleasant to various people who had thought of taking the house, that they drew back,<br>and reka dom had been untenanted for some time. the old woman who took care of it, and from whom<br>we got this information, prophesied further that he would do nothing to the old place. hed let it fall<br>about his ears first. it is also true that standing in the garden which in its rambling, disorderly way<br>was charming, and commanded a lovely view, my father rubbed his head ruefully and said: you know,<br>mary, your mothers chief objection to our latest home was that the grounds were so much too large for<br></P>
