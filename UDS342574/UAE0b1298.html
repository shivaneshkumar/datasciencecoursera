<P>with hot cools at home, and a second time during the morning from the hearthstone of a neighbouring<br>farm house or a noon house these foot warmers helped to make endurable to the goodwives the icy<br>chill of the meeting house; and round their mothers foot stove the shivering little children sat on their<br>low crickets, warming their half frozen fingers, some of these foot stoves were really pretentious church<br>furnishings. i have seen one brassen foot stove which had the ownerd cipher cut out of the sheet metal,<br>and from the side was hung a wrought brass chain. bt this chain, a century ago, the shinning polished<br>brass stove was carried into church in the hands of a liveried black man, who held it ostentatiously at<br>arms length, that neither ash nor scorch might touch his scarlet velvet breeches. and after he had<br>tucked it under my ladys tiny feet as she sat in her pew, he retired to his freezing loft high up among<br>the beams, the nigger pew, where, i am sorry to record, he more than once solaced and warmed himself<br>with a bottle of kill devil which he had smuggled into church, until he fell ignominiously asleep and<br>his drunken snores so disturbed the minister and the congregation, that two lithingmen were forced to<br>climb the ladder like staircase and pull him down and out of the church and to the neighbouring lavern<br>to sleep off the effects of the liquor. for being a man and a brother and, above all, in spite of his petty<br>idiosyncrasies, a very good and cherished servant, he could not be thrust out into the snow to freeze to<br>opening between the two sides of the rift, to find that he could look diagonally across the valley at the<br>openings and terraces far away, but evidently those which would be the unexplored portions of the rock<br>city, opposite the places they had examined. hurrah he cried, as the light seemed to flash into his<br>spirit and give him strength. for a shot rang out from somewhere to his right. he knew it must come<br>from there, for the echo came from beyond the opening on his left. then there was another, and<br>another, to awaken the echoes, followed by silence, during  which he waited for a fresh signal. it came<br>at last, but very faint and distant, and though he shouted several times over, there was no reply. its of<br>no use to wait, muttered chris; they cant hear, and if they did they couldnt help me. i must help<br>myself. feeling this strongly he climbed a little farther, to find that he was at the edge of the zigzag<br>rift, which, as far as he could make out, clove the face of the cliff fom a great height up to far below<br>him; and to damp his spirits the fact was clearly before him that he could go no farther outward, for<br>there was no fancy here he was at the edge of a genuine precipe, and if there was any escape it must<br>be by descending. he stepped back a little way and reached where the stones were piled up roughly,<br>partially filling up the rift, and by using care he was able to descend from block to block, with the<br>water keeping up its musical tinkle far below. why, it must be making its way out into the valley, he<br>thought, and if i can follow it i may be able to get out where it falls, but we saw no falls, he said,<br>after a few minutes thought; but then we never came quite to this end of the place, and only saw it<br>wanted to go, i sud say as the weather was nicely sattled, and start to morrow morning. the hour was<br>settled, as well as the weather, and after obtaining the requisite permission the lads were punctual to<br>their time, and found dave waiting in his punt, upon whose thwart he was seated gravely lying a hook<br>on to a stout piece of twisted horse hair. got everything ready, dave cried dick, ay, lad; all ready, so<br>are we. look, dave, cried dick, swinging up the big basket he carried, pork pie, bread and cheese, and a<br>lump of bacon, and daves face twotched as he listened, but he did not speak, only waited till, after<br>waiting a while to whet the mans anxiety, dick added: and a big battle of beer. oh, i dont want no beer<br>grumbled dave. watters good enough for me. lets leave it behind, tom, said dick archly. it will only be<br>heavy in the boat. nay, put it in, said the man with a dry look. mebbe the fish would like a drop.<br>mak em bite. the boys laughed, and stepped into the punt, which was soon giding over the dark<br>waters that lay in pools and winding lane like canals, dave, in his fox skin cap, standing up in front<br>and handling the pole, the boys carefully examining the contents of the boat. whats in that bucket,<br>dave never mind; you let it alone, said dave gruffly; and dick dropped the net he was raising from the<br>pail. well, lets look at the basket, dave. nay; i weant hev my hooks and lines tangled up just after ive<br>laid en ready. yow two wait and see when we get acrost to wheer the pike lays. oh, very well said dick<br></P>
