<P>foreseat in the front gallery, and the fourth seat below be equal in dignity with the foreseat in the side<br>gallery, etc., thus making many seats of equal honor. of course wives had to have seats of equal<br>importance with those of their husbands, and each widow retained the dignity apportioned to her in her<br>husbands lifetime. we can well believe that much discresing was necessary in dignifying as well as in<br>seating. often, after building a new meeting house with all the painstaking and thoughtful judgment<br>that could be shown, the dissensions over the seating lasted for years. the conciliatory fashion of<br>dignifying the seats clung long in the congregational churches of new england in east hartford and<br>windsor it was not abandoned until many men were unwilling to serve on these seating committees, refused to medle<br>with the seating, protesting against it on account of the adium that was incurred, but<br>they were seldom let off. even so influential and upright a man as judge sewall felt a dread of the<br>responsibility and of the personal spleen he might arouse. he also feared in one case lost his seat<br>decisions might, if disliked, work against the ministerial peace of his son, who had been recently<br>ordained as pastor of the church. sometimes the difficulty was settled in the way. the entire church or<br>rather the male members voted who should occupy the foreseat, or the highest pew, and the voted in<br>occupants of this seat of honor formed a committee, who in turn seated the others of the congregation.<br>where i hid, thought chris, and hell run full into it. but the next moment he felt that thet could not be<br>half way yet, and his ears began to sing in the darkness as the yells of the indians sounded louder and<br>louder, while the echoes given back by the closing in walls were deafening. nearer and nearer they<br>sounded those savage yells and once more chris leaned forward to caress the mustangs neck. oh, go on,<br>old lad, he whispered; faster, faster, or theyll have us. and then the whisper, unheard in the turmoil of<br>yell and echo, became a cry of agony embodied in the simple homely words which told of the bugs<br>suffering and the despair now gripping him by the heart, for out of the black darkness came a fresh<br>burst of yells that were horrible in their intensity, and full of triumph in their tones. as id those who<br>should were certain of their quarry. chris heart sank low indeed, for the end seemed to have come.<br>involuntarily now both hands clutched and clung to the ponys shaggy mane. for just as it seemed to<br>the fugitive that the foremost horses were upon him and their riders hands were outstretched to tear<br>him from his saddle, the mustang made a sudden swerve and what seemed to be a slip. but it did not<br>go down, recovering itself in an instant, but only to drop from a furious gallop into a laboured canter<br>which became directly after a painful walk, while chris felt as if he had received a blow which had<br>stupefied him, deadening his hearing so that he only heard the clatter of horses hoofs and the yelling<br>of the riders as if from a distance, growing fainter and fainter till they died away. whats the matter<br>hundred pieces of eight, or fifteen slaves, the choice left to the party, for the loss of both hands,<br>eighteen hundred pieces of wight or eighteen slaves: for one leg, whether right or left, six hundred<br>pieces of wight , or six slaves for a hand, as much as for a leg; and for the loss of an eye, one hundred<br>pieces of eight, or one slave. lastly, to him that in any battle should signalize himself, either by<br>entering first any castle, or taking down the spanish colours, and setting up the english, they allotted<br>fifty pieces of eight for a reward. all which extraordinary salaries and rewards to be paid out of the<br>first spoil they should take, as every one should occur to be either rewarded or paid, this contract<br>being signed, captain morgan commanded his vice admiral; and captains to put all things in order, to<br>attempt one of these three places; either carthagena, panama, or vera cruz. but the lot fell on panama,<br>as the richest of all threes though this city being situate at such a distance from the north sea as they<br>knew not well the approaches to it, they judged it necessary to go beforehand to the isle of st.<br>catherine, there to find some persons for guides in this enterprise; for in the garrison there are<br>commonly many bandilli and outlaws belonging to panama and the neighbouring places, who are very<br>expert in the knowledge of that country. but before they proceeded, they published an act through the<br>whole fleet, promising, if they met with any spanish vessel, the forst captain who should take it should<br>have for his reward the tenth part of what should be found on her captain morgan leaves hispaniola<br></P>
