<P>his horse, and the next minute he was advancing slowly, with the lanthorn held near the ground. theres<br>nothing here that need have stopped him, but oh, what a blessing what is, sir heres short grass, and<br>the mules cropping it. then theres no canon, sir, said griggs sharply. the poor brutes are all dead beat;<br>theyve come to something that they can nibble, and theyve struck work. the ponies are at it too. its as<br>good as saying that they wont stir another peg till daylight, if they will then. why, two of the mules<br>have regularly squatted down, with their loads touching the ground, said the doctor, holding up the<br>lanthorn. yes, its all right, sir, cried griggs. theres no canon, but level ground all about, ill be bound.<br>theyve called a halt without being told, so we must do the same. but here, with those horrible snakes<br>about cried bourne. none here, sir, said griggs. if there were ont it would have been smelt out by this<br>time, and the poor beasts wouldnt have been so quiet. oh, were right for a time, sir and, i say, hadnt<br>we better follow the beasts example and find a bit of something to eat and drink said wilton. nay,<br>eating will make our mouths turn a bit moist; weve no business to touch any more of that water till we<br>know where the next is to come from. lets chance it, sir, and relieve the poor brutes of their packs. very<br>well, said the doctor, but i dont like halting without knowing our ground. you know my rules that i<br>laid down. no rule without an exception, said wilton drowsily. this is one. i dont want anything to eat,<br>but if i die for it i must sleep. well, ill do the best i can la keep watch with the lanthorn, said the<br>endeavoured also to join thos ship to his own but the french not daaring to trust the english, denied<br>absolutely to consent. the french pirates belonging to this great ship had met at sea an english vessel;<br>and being under great want of rictuals, they had taken some provisions out of the english ship,<br>without paying for them, having, perhaps, no ready money aboard. only they gave them bills of<br>exchange for jamaica and tortuga, to receive money there. captain morgan having notice of this, and<br>perceiving he could not prevail with the french captain to follow him, resolved to lay hold on this<br>occasion, to ruin the french, and seek his revenge, hereupon he invited, with dissimulation, the french<br>commander, and several of his men, to dine with him on board the great ship that was come to<br>jamaica, as is said. being come, he made them all prisoners, pretending the injury aforesaid done to<br>the english vessel. this unjust action of captain morgan was soon followed by divine punishment, as we<br>may conceives the manner i shall instantly relate, captain morgan, presently after he had take these<br>french prisoners, called a council to deliberate what place they should first pitch upon in this new<br>expedition. here it was determined to go to the isle of savana, to wait for the flota then expected from<br>spain, and take any of the spanish vessels straggling from the rest. this resolution being taken, they<br>began aboard the great ship to feast one another for joy of their new voyage, and happy council, as<br>they hoped; they drank many healths, and discharged many guns, the common sign of mirth among<br>seamen. most of the men being drunk, by what accident is not known, the ship suddenly was blown up,<br>but of course, bad no idea of what had happened. the pirates received them with great civility, and<br>deceived them with a false description of their voyage of being bound to a southern port with prisoners;<br>and the two captains, not having the slightest suspicion of who their hosts really were, passed a very<br>merry evening with these marauders. soon, however, their bad management of the vessel, their want of<br>discipline, and the general confusion on board, roused a vague suspicion in the minds of the two<br>captains that all was not quite right on board the wellington, the real captain, too, had succeeded in<br>conveying a note to duke, informing him of his situation, and claiming his assistance to recapture the<br>brig, and entreating him to release them all from captivity. this communication produced universal<br>alarm, as both the whalers were quite unprovided for attack or defence, and all the missionary<br>settlements lay quite at the mercy of this band of pirates, had the latter acted with promptness and<br>spirit, they might easily have made themselves masters of the whole but while they were arguing and<br>hesitating where they would make their first attack, the whalers were actively employed in getting their<br>great guns out of the hold, and in preparing their vessels for defence; so that, by the time the pirates<br>came to the resolution to attack them, the whalers were in a good posture for resistance, and finally<br></P>
