<P>taking dimensions as usual, a blue black ceetle sat humming on the stake, and dragon flies flitted<br>hungrily about, like splinters of a broken rainbow; but the water soldiers place was empty, and it was<br>never refilled he was the only specimen. molly was probably in the right when, after a last vain search<br>for the scarlet spider, as francis slowly emptied the pail, she said with a sigh, what makes me so very<br>sorry is, that i dont think we ought to have collected things unless we had really attended to them, and<br>knew how to keep them alive footnotes: footnote d: water soldier stratiotes aloides. a handsome and<br>rare plant, of aloe like appearance, with a white blossom rising in the centre of its sword leaves.<br>among the merrows. a sketch of a great aquarium. i remember the time when i, and a brother who was<br>with me, devouted believed in a being whom we supposed to live among certain black, water rotted,<br>grown stakes by the sea. these old wooden ruins were, i fancy, the remains of some rude pier, and amid<br>them, when the tide was low, we used to play, and to play fancy visits to our fancy friend. we called her<br>shriny why, i know no more than when i first read crakers delightful story of the soul cages i knew<br>why the merrow whom jack went to see below the waves was called coomara.mnry remembrance of even<br>what we fancied about shriny is very dim now; and as my brother was only four years old i was eight,<br>his is not more distinct. i know we thought of her, and talked of her, and were always eager to visit<br>her supposed abode, and wander together amongst its ratten pillars which, as we were so small, seemed<br>equipped with a long staff, heavily knobbed at one end, with which he severrly and pitilessly rapped<br>the heads of the too sleepy men, and the too wide awake boys. from the other end of this wand of<br>office depended a long foxtail, or a hares foot, which he softly thrust in the faces of the sleeping<br>priscillas, charitys, and hopestills, and which gently brushed and tickled them into reverent but startled<br>wakefulness. one zealous but too impetuous lithingman in his pious ardor of office inadvertently<br>applied the wrong end, the end with the heavy knob, the masculine end, to a drowsy matrons head; and<br>for this several ungallant mistake he was cautioned by the ruling elders to thereafter use more<br>discresing and less heist. another over watchful newbury awakener rapped on the head a nodding man<br>who protested indignantly that he was wide awake, and was only bowing in solemn assent and<br>approval of the ministers arguments. roger scott, of lynn, in struck the lithingman who thus roughly<br>and suddenly wakened him; and poor sleepy and bewildered roger, who is branded through all time as a<br>common sleeper at the publick exercise, was, for this most naturally resentful act, but also most<br>shockingly grave offence, soundly whipped, as a warning both to keep awake and not to strike back in<br>meeting. obadiah turner, of lynn, gives in his journal a sad, sad disclosure of total depravity which<br>was exposed by one of these sudden church awakenings, and the story is best told in the journalists<br>own vivid words: june, allen bridges hath bin chose to wake ye sleepers in meeting. and being much<br>proude of his place, must needs have a fox taile fixed to ye ende of a long staff wherewith he may<br>evidently dying fast. i might try and do something now, said the doctor thoughtfully, if the poor beast<br>were held. too late, said griggs quietly. i dont understand much about snake poison, but i should say<br>thats running all through the poor thing now but chriss father would not give up. hide ropes were cast<br>loose, while he hurried to the load which contained the little case of medicines and surgical appliances<br>which was kept ready ready for emergencies, and then armed with bottle and syringe he superintended while<br>nooses were placed around the poor animals neck and four fetlocks, each being tightened and the rope<br>held by some one. chris and ned were ordered to the fore legs, griggs took the neck rope, and wilton<br>and bourne the hind legs. at a word from the doctor the ropes were drawn taut and the poor beast<br>stretched out helplessly upon its back, while the doctor seated himself astride, sought for the tiny<br>punctures made by the rattlesnakes poison fangs, and found them where the skin was thinnest and<br>most devoid of hair, the successful discovery being due to a tiny drop of yellowish gummy matter which<br>had oozed out. a caustic was applied to this as soon as the tiny wound had been freely lanced and set<br>bleeding and then with the proper instrument a strong application of ammonia was forced into one of<br>the mules larger veins, and all with the slightest of resistance being offered. lastly, encouraged by the<br></P>
