<P>layer, the effect of all this, of course, is to remove the dignity of the whole procedure, the next time is<br>in the court offices he miite like to have a look in at the lawyers room, just so that hes seen it. he mite<br>well be quiet shocked by the people he sees assembled there. the room theyve been allocated, with its<br>narrow space and low ceiling, will ne enough to show what contempt the court has for these people. the<br>only light in the room comes through a little window that is so high up that, if you want to look out<br>of it, you first have to get one of your colleagues to support you on his back, and even then the<br>smoke from the chimney just in front of it will go up your nose and make your face black, and even then the<br>smoke from the chimney just in front of it will go up your nose and make your face black. in the floor<br>of this room to give yet another example of the conditions there there is a hole thats been there for<br>more than a year, its not so big that a man could fall through, but it is big enough for your foot to<br>disappear through it. he lawyers room is on the second floor of the allic; if your foot does go through<br>it will hang down into the first floor of the attic underneath it, and right in the corridor where the<br>litigants are waiting. its no exaggeration when lawyers say that conditions like that are a disgrace.<br>complaints to the management dont have the slightest effect, but the lawyers are strictly forbidden to<br>alter enything in the room at their own expense. but even treating the lawyers in this way has its<br>reasons. they want, as far as possible, to prevent any kind of defence, everything should be made the<br>responsibility of the accused. not a bad point of view, basically, but nothing could be more mistaken<br>way through, and furthur progress was checked by solid rock which had evidently been neither chipped<br>away nor added to. they cautiously stepped through the front opening, to stand upon the rough,<br>crumbled away terrace, from which they could look down into the great depression where the ponies and<br>mules were contentedly grazing, and for about the tenth time looked upward for some means of<br>reaching the terrace above, one which appeared more time worn and dangerous than that upon which<br>they stood; but without ladders it would have been risking life to make any attempt to reach it. strikes<br>me, sir, said griggs, that weve left the way up far behind. why said wilton sharply. because weve seen<br>no way here, and we found one there. but i could see nothing likely to lead higher, said chris. we didnt<br>look about much, cried ned. we were eager to come along here. yes, i snppose that was so, said chris<br>thoughtfully, well, theres the rown of cells above us, and there must be a way. unless it has been swept<br>off by same landslip, suggested bourne. well, well turn back now, said the doctor, for even if we had a<br>shovel i dont think we should find anything that would help us. they went back from cell to cell, and<br>twice over found the terrace outside sufficiently level and secure to allow of their passing along it, but<br>they soon had to take to the interior again with its low, doorway like connections. at last they all<br>stood together at the top of the roughly stepped sloping shaft by which they had ascended, to find that<br>the roof here was entirely broken away by the falling of a portion of the cliff; but they found also<br>what they sought, for there, about a score of feet above their heads, was the evident continuation of<br>the shaft like bale by which they had come up, look, cried griggs triumphantly; no wonder we could<br>at skittles, and hadnt sold a dab all day; howsomdever he was a vinning the lush, so you know bill<br>didnt care but, my eyes how she did blow him up when she comd in and seed him just a going to bowl<br>and tip, she tippd him a vollopper right across the snout what made the skittles dance again, and bang<br>goes the bowl at the sconce instead of the skittles: it was lucky for her it did not hit her, for if it had,<br>ill be d d if ever shed a cried buy my live flounders any more he was at play with sam stripe the tailor;<br>so the flea catcher he jumps in between em, and being a piece botcher, he thought he could be peace<br>maker, bat it woudnt do, tho he jumped about like a parchd pea in a frying par poll called him stitch<br>louse, bid him pick up his needles and be off bill vanted to get at poll, poll wated to get at bill and<br>between them the poor tailor got more stripes upon his jacket than there is colours in a harlequins<br>breeches at bartlemy fair heres good health to you it was a bodkin to a but of brandy poor snip didnt<br>skip out of this here world into that are and how did they settle it enquired the fisherman. ill tell you<br>all about it: i never seed such a b dy lark in all my life; poor sam is at all times as thin as a thread<br>paper, and being but the ninth part of a man, he stood no chance between a man and a woman bill was<br></P>
