<P>stark and the rangers, asking humphrey what had been known of them since the breaking up of the<br>band after the disaster of liconderaga, i sae stark, answered humphrey eagerly, have i not told you<br>before ah well, we have not much time for talking these busy days. yes, i saw stark; he came to visit<br>his kinsfolk of the inn when i was in philadelphia. he has gone now, with amhersts party, he will join<br>rogers, i suppose; and doubtless, the rangers will again do good service, as they do everywhere. he was<br>in half a mind to come north with the expedition for quebec, but decided that he would be of more use<br>in country every fool of which was familiar to him. but he declared that, if once tinconderoga were to<br>fall, he would bring us the news faster than anyother messenger how he will come, and by what<br>route, i know not; but this i know, that if there is a victory for english arms yonder in the west, and if<br>john stark he not killed, the sight of his face, vried fritz, be his news what it may.<br>john stark is one of the best and bravest men i know. i have told our general many a tale of him and<br>his prowess, wolfe will have a welcome for him if he ever appears here, wolfe seemed to have finished<br>his survey. he took the glass from his eye and looked round him. mondon was at his side in a<br>moment. he, in common with all who fought with and under him, had a great admiration for the<br>gallant young general. mondon, said wolfe, in a voice loud enough for the other three to hear plainly,<br>was all broke now, and better that way half way was no good. it was better to be an out and out than<br>a neither one nor the other. he had had some large plans, until the professor had started the run<br>against him. had had a vision, a vision of prosperity and himself a settled man, and maybe some day<br>some day, then had proved himself when hed found her he wouldnt even tell himself how disappointed<br>he was. noon came and they tarried a while. there was no hurry; they werent going anywhere, not<br>anywhere in particular, presently they started on again. and through the glare of afternoon they<br>passed along the horizon, a despondent scarecrow, upon a rejected horse. ride him,cowboy so to the<br>tanks; but here atleast was a little luck. the tub was full and overflowing; he would not have to<br>course the agent to swear by swinging round the nozzle and wasting of his water. and something besides<br>sagebush and sang to look at, too, for upon the tracks stood a train; a train packed very full with<br>men whose faces showed white at  the windows, indoor men, eastern men, and a private car at the end of<br>the string. all men well, that would be the special train, come through from the other coast; the prize<br>fight special, and the ;last section, at that there was no man up the tracks with a red glag to guard<br>against a pile up. and they also looked bored; they must have been standing there quite a while. and<br>hot. so, you see, his plight was not so bad he didnt have to breathe that air and sit in a slippery red<br>plush seat. not much he went to the drip, serenely careless of the thousand eyes upon him; he drank<br>these matters are often simple enough, but when they go way certain difficulties arise. they go<br>amongst people whose little habits are not the same as those to which they have been accustomed.<br>sometimes they come to very uncharitable conclusions upon their friends characters in consequence. i must say, that<br>i have never met with any one who could be more severe than young people of your<br>age are apt to be. i remember it of myself, and i have seen it in so many other girls. home is<br>naturally the standard, and whatever is different seems wrong. as life goes on, these young critics learn<br>or should learn to distinguish between general and particulat duties; and also coming to know a larger<br>number of people,they find that all good persons are not cut to the same pattern, and that ones<br>friends little ways are not therefore absurd, because one does not happen to be used to them. on the<br>other hand, if going amongst other people may tempt you to be critical of their little habits, it is also<br>apt to make you neglect your own. perhaps you think this cannot much matter, as they are not the<br>great duties, and as other people seem to get on quite well without them. but one learns in the end,<br>that no character of any value is formed without the discipline of individual rules, and that rules are of<br>no use that are not held to against circumstances, charitable to others, severe to himself, seems a<br>maxim for grown up people in grown up things; but, i believe, my little daughters, that the doubts and<br></P>
