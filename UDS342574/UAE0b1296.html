<P>when a baby was baptized, the minister prayed for a mitigation of the weather, and on the same day<br>in another town rev. mr. wigglesworth preached on the text, who can stand before his cold then by his<br>own and peoples sickness three sabbaths passed without public worship. february he preached from<br>these words: he sends forth his word and thaws them. and the very next day a thaw set in which was<br>regarded as a direct answer to his prayer and sermon. sceptics now a days would suggest that he chose<br>well the time to pray for milder weather. many persons now living can remember the universal and<br>noisy turning up of great coat collars, the swinging of arms, and knocking together of the heavy<br>booted feet of the listeners towards the end of a long winter sermon. dr. hopkins used to say, when the<br>noisy lintamarre began, my hearers, have a little patience, and i will soon close. another clergyman<br>was irritated beyond endurance by the stamping, clattering feet, a supplosio pedis that he regarded as<br>an irreverant protest and complaint against the severity of the weather, rather than as a hint to him to<br>conclude his long sermon. he suddenly and noisily closed his sermon book, leaned forward out of his<br>high pulpit, and thundered out these bibilical words of rebuke at his freezing congregation, whose<br>startled faces stared up at him through dense clouds of vapor. out of whose womb came the ice and the<br>hoary frost of heaven, who hath gendered it the waters are hid as with a stone, and the face of the<br>deep is frozen. knowest thou the ordinance of heaven canst thou set the dominion thereof on the earth<br>great things doth god which we cannot comprehend he saith to the snow, be thou on the earth by the<br>position, and then there was a dull heavy shock, when the apparently solid piece of ledge, after being<br>exposed to the atmosphere for ages, crumbled into dust and went on downward with a curious<br>whispering rush along a steep slope instead of over a perpendicular wall. choking with the dust which<br>arose, rolled over and over and half blinded, chris was stunned by the confusion of the rush, for how<br>long he could not tell, and then there was a sudden stoppage, and he lay half buried in the debris of<br>the little earthen avalanche. for a few moments the lad was too much stunned to attempt to move, and<br>lay notionless, trying to pierce the thick dust which closed him in. then the horror and dread of his<br>position came upon him with terrible force, and he began to struggle violently, increasing the dust, but<br>getting first one arm and then the other free, then matters grew more easy, he dragged himself<br>sidewise, and shovelfuls of the debris dropped from his hips, while he could feel that his legs were<br>looser then another desperate struggle, and he was on the outside of the sloping heap, but only to set,<br>the surface in motion again and roll and glide down and over and over once more, till he was<br>brought up short in the narrowest part of a wedge shaped mountain cleft, to begin struggling again,<br>trampling as if rapidly ascending stairs, to avoid being buried by the gliding rubbish still in motion<br>and filling up the bottom of the rift. the dust was still forming a cloud, but it was floating away,<br>leaving the bare sides of the cleft clear enough for him to see far above him where the ledge ran<br>lovely spider a water spider a scarlet spider. hes very small, but such a colour frarcis dear, may i keep<br>him all to myself i dont think i can let him go in with the others. if the dragon fly larva ate him, i<br>should never forgive myself, and you know you dont know for certain that the beetle is hydrous piceus.<br>i shall give him an aquarium of his very own in a green finger glass, with nothing but a little very<br>nice duckweed, and one small snail to keep it clean, like a general servant. may i, francis by all<br>means. i dont want your scarlet spider. i can get lots more. he went on dipping with the calender, and<br>she began to dig up water plants and lay them in a heap. i sat and watched them, but the ranatra got<br>nervous and tried to go below as usual, the dry bristles in his tail would not pierce the water without<br>a struggle, and after floundering in the most ludicrous fashion for a few minutes, he fell straight into<br>the calander, and was put into one of the pickle jars. ive got enough now, said the boy. and i want to<br>go home and see about my net. i must have some fish. can you carry the plants, molly ill manage,<br>said molly. now im ready wait a minute, though id forgotten the beetle. when i heard this i dropped<br>into the waters; but somehow or other i turned over very clumsily, and, like the ranatra, i fell through<br>into the calander, and was transfered to a pickle jar. anything more disagreeable than being shaken<br></P>
