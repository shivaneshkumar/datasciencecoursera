<P>merman all the same, or else how could he live in the mere i know more about brownies than granny<br>does, and i shall tell her so for tommy was somewhat opinionated, like other young people. the moon<br>shone very brightly on the centre of the mere. tommy knew the place well, fot there was a fine echo<br>there. round the edge grew rushes and water plants, which cast a border of shadow. tommy went to the<br>north side, and turning himself three times, as the old owl had told him, be repeated the charm twist<br>me, and turn me, and slow me the elf i looked in the water, and saw now for it he looked in, and saw<br>the reflection of his own face. why, theres no one but myself said tommy and what can the word be i<br>must have done it worng. wrong said the echo. tommy was almost surprised to find the echo awake at<br>this time of night. hold your tounge said he. matters are provoking enough of themselves. beff celf delf<br>felf getf helf plf what rubbish there cant be a word to fit it. and then to look for a brownie, and see<br>nothing but myself myself, said the echo.will you be quiet said tommy if you would tell one the word<br>there would be some sense in your interference; but to roar myself at one, which neither rhymes nor<br>runs it does rhyme though, as it happens, he addes and how very add it runs too twist me, and turn<br>me, and show me the elf i looked in the water, and saw myself, which i certains did. what can it mean<br>the old owl knows, as granny would say; so i shall go back and ask her. ask her said the echo. didnt<br>i say i should said tommy. how exasperating you are it is very strange. myself certainly does rhyme,<br>idolatry and in the middle of his petition the minister usually made a long pause in order that any<br>who were infirm or ill might let down their slamming pew seats and sit down, those who were merely<br>weary stood patiently to the long and painfully deferred end. this custom of standing during prayer<br>time prevailed in the congregational churches in new england until quite a recent date, and is not yet<br>obsolete in insolated communities and in solitary cases. i have seen within a few years, in a country<br>church, a feeble, white haired old deacon rise tremblingly at the preachers solemn words let us unite in<br>prayer and stand with bowed head throughout the long prayer; thus pathetically clinging to the<br>reverent custom of the olden time, he rendered lender trubute to vanished youth, gave equal tribute to<br>eternal hope and faith, and formed a beautiful emblem of patient readiness for the last solemn<br>summons. sometimes tedious expounding of the scriptures and long prophesying lengthened out the<br>too long service. judge sewall recorded that once when he addressed or expounded at the<br>plymouth church, being afraid to look at the glass, ignorantly and unwittingly i stood two hours and<br>a half, which was doing pretty well for a layman. the members of the early churches did not dislike<br>these long preachings and prophesying; they would have regarded a short sermon as irreligious, and<br>lacking inreverence, and besides, would have fell that they had not received in it their full due, their<br>full moneys worth. they often fella sleep and were fiercely awakened by the lithingman, and often they<br>and dying out again as the soft hreeze blew down the gully from time to time. cant see or hear<br>anything of the animals, said griggs, at last, as he strode up with the light. aint heard any more of<br>mr bar, have you no, was the reply. they were seared off by the shooting, i expect, or else by getting a<br>sniff of the bars wound. would they go far ashed the doctor, cant say, sir, but not so far that we cant<br>follow them by their trail. its a great nuisance, just when we had decided to make an early start in the<br> morning. now everything depends upon our findings the animals and bringing them back. there was of<br>course no mere sleep that night, neither, much as it was expected, was there my return of the visitor<br>of the night during the long hours of the watch. but the morning broke at last, and as soon as it was<br>light enough the party began to follow the trail of the bear, starting from the spot where bourne had<br>his alarming adventure, the traces of which were plain enough, the earth and growth being torn up by<br>the brutes claws. from there the spots of blood which had fallen from the bears wound were plain<br>enough at intervals, and they were followed for about a quarter of a mile, where the animal had<br>plunged into the dense forest, where the trees and undergrowth presented a front that could not be<br>penetrated by a human being, though comparatively easy for a quadruped. further pursuit was given<br>up, and the party returned to follow up the trail of the ponies and mules. this was found at once, the<br></P>
