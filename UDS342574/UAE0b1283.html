<P>goods and merchandise, not sparing those lived in the fields, such as hunters and planters.<br>they had scarce been eighteen days on the place, when the greatest part of the prisoners died for<br>in the town were few provisions, especially of flesh, though they had same, but no sufficient quantity<br>of flour of meal and this the pirates had taken for themselves, as they also took the swine, cows,<br>sleep, and poultry, without allowing any share to the poor prisoners; for these they only provided<br>some small quantity of mules and asses flesh and many who could not eat of that loathsome provision<br>hunger, their stomachs not being accustomed to such sustenance. of the prisoners many also died under<br>the torment they sustained to make them discover their money or jewels; and of these deaths. finally, after<br>having been in possession of the town four entire weeks, they sent four of the prisoners to the<br>spaniards that were fled to the woods, demanding of them a ransom for not burning the town. the sum<br>demanded was, pieces of eight, which if not sent, they threatened to reduce it to ashes. for bringing in<br>this money, they allowed them only two days but the spaniards not having been able to gather so<br>punctually such a sum, the pirates fired many parts of the town whereupon the inhabitants begged<br>them to help quench the fire, and the ransom should ne readily paid. the pirates condescended, helping<br>that does not mean ive abandoned what i thought earlier as the two versions are, to some extent, not<br>incomaptible. its not clear whether the doorkeeper sees clearly or is deceived. i said the man had been<br>cheated. if the doorkeeper understands clearly, then there could be some doubt it, but if the<br>doorkeeper has been deceived then the man is bound to believe the same thing. that would mean the<br>doorkeeper is not a cheat but so simple minded that he ought to be dismissed from his job<br>immediately; if the doorkeepers is mistaken it will do him no harm hut the man will be harmed<br>immensely. there youve found another opinion, said the priest, as there are many who say the story<br>doesnt give anyone the right to judge the doorkeeper. however he mule seem to us he is still in the<br>service of the law, so he belongs to the law, so hes beyond what man has at right to judge. in this case<br>we cant believe the doorkeeper is the mans subordinate. even if he has to stay at the entrance into the<br>law his service makes him incomparable more than if he lived freely in the world. the man has come to<br>the law for the first time and the doorkeeper is already there. hes been given his position by the law,<br>to doubt his worth would be to doubt the law. i cant say im in complete agreement with this view, said<br>shaking his head, as if you accept it youll have to accepth that everything said by the doorkeeper is<br>true. but youve already explained very fully that thats not possible. no, said the priest, you dont need<br>to accept everything as true, you only have to accept it as necessary. depressing view, said the lie made<br>into the rule of the world. said that as if it were his final word but it was not his conclusion. he was<br>we did the mules and horses dream it too cried chris scornfully no, of course not. but its a puzzle, my<br>lad. i wouldnt have believed such a sight possible; but there it was, and now i wouldnt have believed<br>this could have happened; but it has, for i cant see a snake. never mind the snakes as theyre not here,<br>said chris, setting the example of reining up, for the two mustangs to stand calmly enough; i want to<br>find those two water barrel. oh, to be sure weve come for them, said griggs, looking curiously about.<br>i say, was that the mule that carried the kegs oh yes didnt you see the pack saddle to be sure. if it<br>hadnt been for that i should have been ready to say that the one with the water had gone right off<br>somewhere. oh, that was the one, persisted chris. i know hinr well enough by his white muzzle to be<br>sure thats right then where are the kegs snakes aint thirsty things they couldnt have rolled them<br>away. could they what nonsense cried chris. but it is really strange. if we were on a slope i should have<br>thought that they had gone rolling right away out of sight. we are in a steep slope, lad, but the barrel<br>would have to roll up it to get out of sight like this, and i never knew barrel carry on games like that out of<br>a book of fairy tales. griggs, cried chris, after a moment or two of thought, are we in the<br>right place these stones are very confusing. right place yes, look there; you can see our trail. yes,<br>replied chris thoughtfully, as he bent down over his saddle bow, and ugh look there eh see snakes cried<br></P>
