<P>many of ye boyes as may be convenient, and if any are unruly, to present their names, as the law<br>directs, nowadays we should hardly seat boys in a group if we wished them to be orderly and decorous,<br>and i fear the man by the name of grippy found it no easy task to preserve order and due gravity<br>among the puritan boys in salem meeting. in fact, the rampant boys behaved thus badly for the very<br>reason that they were seated together instead of with their respective families and not until the fasion<br>was universal of each family sitting in a pew or a group by itself did the boys in meeting behave like<br>human beings rather than like mischieves and unruly monkeys in stratford, in, a lithingman was<br>appointed to watch over the youths of disorderly carriage, and see that they behave themselves and use<br>such raps and blows as in his direction meet. i like to think of those rows of sober faced<br>puritan boys seated on the narrows, steep pulpit stairs, clad in knee breeches and homespun flopped<br>coats, and with round, cropped heads, miniature likeliness in dress and countenance if not in<br>eportment of their grave, stern, god fearing fathers. though they were of the sedate puritan blood,<br>they were boys, and they wriggled and twisted, and scraped their feet noisily on the sanded floor, and i<br>know full well that the square toed shoes of one in whom original sin waxed powerful, thrust many a<br>sly dig in the ribs and back of the luckless wight who chanced to sit in front of and below him on the<br>rough ledge upon which he was perched, when his heart leaped at the sound of a familiar voice hailing<br>him with a cheery ahoy forty four. open air surgery. griggs shouted chris excitedly. why, there you are<br>the doctors gone the other way to see if he could find a gully by which he could climb up to try and<br>find you. i came this way. same purpose, and ive got all the luck. take care mind these stones are<br>slippery. yes, ill mind, said chris, as he descended the rocks backwards. this is nothing but hadnt you<br>better run and tell father youve found me nay im not going to brag. i didnt find you, you seem to have<br>found me. then you havent broken your neck no. how many legs are snapped none, said chris, who<br>threatened to break one directly, so reckless was his progress. arms, then im all right, i tell you, only<br>a bit knocked about, but wheres ned along with his father on the upper terrace, giving the indians a<br>bit of a shot now and then to keep them from coming up after the mules. but can they do it alone oh<br>yes; the brutes are sad cowards and dont like powder and shot at all. there cried chris, leaping to earth<br>and coming close to the american. now then, i went to join father. thats soon done, said griggs, but<br>keep an eye up towards the top yonder, and ware arrows. yes, i know, said chris excitedly. of course<br>you do; but theyll be pretty shy of showing themselves now, after our bit of shooting. walk quicker,<br>said chris. but tell me, how did the enemy attack you thats what we want you to tell us. lad. when<br>they began we were afraid they had got you. how did it all happen chris explained in a few words, and<br>then began questioning, to learn how those he had left behind were nearly taken by surprise, but their<br>unprovided as the former. at a small distance were several pantation, which they searched very<br>narrowly, bat could not find any person, animal, or other thing, to relieve their extreme hunger.<br>finally, having ranged about, and searched a long time, they found a grot, which seemed to be but<br>lately hewn out of a rock, where were two sacks of meal, wheat, and like things, with two great jars of<br>wine, and certain fruits called platanoes. captain morgan, knowing some of his men were now almost<br>dead with hunger, and fearing the same of the rest, caused what was found to be distributed among<br>them who were in greatest necessity. having refreshed themselves with these victuals, they marched with greater<br>courage than ever. such as were weak were put into the canoes, and those commanded to<br>land that were in them before. thus they prosecuted their journey till late at nights when coming to a<br>plantation, they took up their rest, but without eating anything; for the spaniards, as before, had<br>swept away all manner of provisions. the sixth day they continued their march, part by land and part by water. howbeit, they were constrained to rest very frequently, both for the ruggedness of the way,<br>and their extreme weakness, which they endeavoured to relieve by eating leaves of trees and green<br>herbs, or grassy such was their miserable condition. this day at noon they arrived at a plantation,<br>where was a born full of maize. immediately they beat down the doors and ate it dry, as mush as they<br></P>
