<P>griggs leading, the first a little in advance, and bearing the light, so as to avoid the blocks of stone<br>projecting from the sand, the little party went slowly on hour after hour, ready to stop again and<br>again to throw themselves down and rest. but no one dared to do so lest the jar given to the earth<br>should send some of the poisonous reptiles to the surface in search of the enemy that had intruded<br>upon the solitude which they seemed from their numbers to have marked down for their own domain.<br>the greater part of that night seemed to the two boys like a feverish dream, during which they had<br>been compelled by some strange force to keep plodding on through horrors unspeakable, and tortured<br>by a thrist that was maddening. at times, where the stones lay thick, hardy a word was spoken, but<br>now and again chris would begin questioning his companion loudly, eager to obtain his opinion as to<br>whether he did not think it must be nearly morning. but neds answers were not encouraging. there was<br>no romance in them; they were too near the truth to suit chris, and he liked them the less becaus at<br>heart he felt that they must be correct and his own hopes too sanguine, hut all the same he clung to<br>his own ideas they were so tempting. they were that with daylight they should have reached the end of<br>the wild desert, and that from high up on some sunlit slope they would be gazing down into a broad<br>green valley some natural paradise through which flowed a rippling stream. he described his notions to<br>many cattle for no sooner hath a cow calved or a more foaled but these wild mastiffs devour the<br>young, if they find not resistance from keepers and domestic dogs. they run up and down the woods<br>and fields, commonly fifty, threescore, or more, together being withal so fierce, that they will often<br>assault an entire herd of wild boars, not ceasing to worry them till they have fetched down two or<br>three. one day a french buccaneer showed me a strange action of this kind: being in the fields a<br>hunting together, we heard a great noise of dogs which has surrounded a wild boar. having tame dogs<br>with us. we left them to the custody of our servants, being desirous to see the sport. hence my<br>companion and i climbed up two several trees, both for security and prospect. the wild boar: all alone,<br>stood against a tree, defending himself with his tusks from a great number of dogs that enclosed him;<br>killed with his teeth, and wounded several of them. this bloody fight continued about an hour the wild<br>boar, meanwhile, attempting many times to escape at last flying, one dog, leaping upon his back,<br>fastened on his throat. the rest of the dogs, perceiving the courage of their companions, fastened<br>likewise on the boar, and presently killed him this done, all of them, the first only expected, laid<br>themselves down upon the ground about the prey, and there peaceably continued, till he, the first and<br>most courageous of the troop, had ate as much as he could; when this dog had left off, all the rest fell<br>in to take their share, till nothing was left. what ought we to infer from this notably action, performed<br>by wild animals, but this. that even beasts themselves are not destitute of knowledge, and that they<br>give us documents how to honour such as have deserved well even since these irrational animals did<br>themselves the most adroit and active thieves imaginable, though previously to that event we had never<br>lost an article, although everything we possessed was open to them. when we questioned them about<br>our property, they frankly told us where it was; and after some difficulty in settling the amount of its<br>ransom, we got most of our things back again, with the exception of such as had been carried off by<br>the ngapuhs. upon the cruelty of this custom i shall make no comments. probably i should have<br>remained in ignorance of this savage jlaw, had i not had the misfortune to become its victim. by<br>redeeming from the natives what they had purloined from the fire, we had restored to us some of our<br>boxes, desks, and clothes; but all our little comforts towards housekeeping were irretrievably last. when<br>the fire was over we received a visit from one of the missionaries, who made us a cold offer of<br>assistance. we accepted a little tea, sugar and some few articles of crockery from them but, although<br>they knew we stood there horseless, amongst a horde of savages, they never offered us the shelter<br>of their roofs. i am very sure that had the calamity befallen them, we should immediately have offered our<br>huts, and shared with them everything we possessed. here was an oppurtunity of practically showing<br>the pagans as they termed the new zealanders the great christian doctrine of doing to others as we<br></P>
