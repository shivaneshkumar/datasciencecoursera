<P>themselves as near to the ornamental bones as possible, they immediately began their howling and<br>slashing; no one seemed to like the idea of being outdone by his neighbor; but when the time alloted<br>to this ceremony had expired, all instantly jumped up, wiped themselves, put on their mats, and joined<br>the busy throng. there was, indeed, one real mourner, who never moved from the bones, nor once lifred<br>up her eyes from them; she neither howled nor cut herself, and yet she inspired me with pitty and<br>commiseration for her forlorn state. this woman had been the only wife of the late chief; and i was<br>informed they had lived many years together, and had a large family; she looked as if she herself was<br>on the very bbrink of the grave. the contemplation of the mouldering remains of her partner through life<br>must have been, even to her savage mind, most lacerating. after witnessing several parties perform<br>funeral ceremonies, and imbibing, in some degree, the meancholy tone of mind such a sight must<br>necessarily create, we arose and joined mooetara. here i witnessed a scene that reminded me of an<br>english country fair. an immense number of temporary huts had been erected for the accommodation of<br>the chiefs and their families, where they might repose after their exertions, whike their slaves cooked<br>their provisions, of which an abundant quantity had been provided, consisting of piles of kumara and<br>indian corn, with heaps of fish, which were served out, to all who came for them, with a most libernal<br>hand, and which, of course, added not a little to the pleasure of the day. after all had satisfied their<br>hunger and even the lowest slaves were permitted, on this occasion, to have as much as they wished for<br>if the rock were granite. yes i see where you mean a little higher up than we are. thats right. now, <br>just above it theres a patch of green running up to the fix trees, all low bushes sprinkled about with<br>the rocks between yes, said chris, i can see that too well look, chris, cried ned; i can see it now<br>there, just crossing from one lot of bushes to another. there it goes. yes, i see now, why, you mean<br>wool, griggs, its a mountain sheeps. no, it isnt, cried chris excitedly; its a bear. yes, all alive, oh and in<br>his skin coat. and quite beyond reach, unless we stalk hum. i say, griggs, how lucky is that a grizzly<br>oh, no; theyre twice as big. thats only a brown bear. but is he coming after our mules not he. hes<br>hunting for wild fruit berries and things of that sort. then its not a dangerous one not if you leave him<br>alone. hed show fight, though, i dare say, if you went after him. lets climb hinger up and get above<br>him. we can easily get a shot at him then, said chris. do you want to eat him, cried ned,<br>watching care about eating him, though bear ham isnt bad. oh we dont want to eat him, cried ned,<br>watching the movements of the brute eagerly. you dont want his fat to make bears grease for your<br>hair, do you ofcourse not. then id leave him alone. weve plenty of ammunition now, bat we dont want<br>to waste any. but suppose he had been a grizzly said chris, bringing the glass to bear on the distant<br>animal. if it had been a grizzly i should say the best thing would be to let him alone, and the same<br>with a cinnamon, for theyre very dangerous beasts. if either of them came smelling after the mules or<br>ponies of course it would be a different thing. there wouldnt be room enough for him and us too on the<br>been far too rash in coming here but now he had to give the painter some sort of answer and, glancing<br>at the easel, said, are you working on a picture currently yes, said the painter, and he look the shirt<br>hanging over the easel and threw it onto the bed after the letter, its a portrait. quite a good piece of<br>work, although its not quite finished yet. this was a convenient coincidence for it gave him a good<br>oppurtunity to talk about the court as the picture showed, very clearly, a judge. whats more, it was<br>remarkably similar to the picture in the lawyers office, although this one showed a quite different<br>judge, a heavy man with a full beard which was black and bushy and extended to the sides far up the<br>mans cheeks. the lawyers picture was also an oil painting, whereas this one had been made with pastel<br>colours and was pale and unclear. but everything else about the picture was similar, as this judge, too,<br>was holding tightly to the arm of his throne and seemed aminously about to rise from it. at first was<br>about to say, he certainly is a judge, but he held himself back for the time being and went closer to<br>the picture as if he wanted tostudy it in detail. there was a large figure shown in middle of the<br>thrones back rest which could not understand and asked the painter about it. thatll need some more<br></P>
