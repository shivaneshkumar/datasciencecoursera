<P>his congregation to battle. the church in yorkm maine, until the year, felt it necessary to retain the<br>custom of carrying arms to the meeting house, so plentiful and so aggressive were maine indians. not<br>only in the time of indian wars were armed men seen in the meeting house, but on june, the provincial<br>congress recommended that the men wothin twenty miles of the sea coast carry their arms and<br>ammunition with them to meeting on the sabboth and other days when they meet for public worship.<br>and on many a sabboth and lecture day, during the years of war that followed, were proved the wisdom<br>and foresight of that suggestion. the men in those old days of the seventeenth century, when in <br>constant dread of attacks by indians, always rose when the services were ended and left the house<br>before the women and children, thus ,making sure the safe exit of the latter. this custom prevailed from<br>habit until a late date in many churches in new england, all the men, after the benediction and the exit<br>of the parsons, walking out in advance of the women, so also the custom of the men always sitting at<br>the head or door of the pew arose from the early necessity of their always being ready to seize their<br>arms and rush unobstructed to fight. in some new england village churches to this day, the man who<br>would move down from his end of the pew and let a woman sit at the door, even if it were a more<br>desirable seat from which to see the clergyman, would be thought a poor sort of a creature. iii. by<br>drum and horn and shell. at about nine o clock on the sabbath morning the puritan colonists assembled<br>did, syuire, but theres no water here. allys dry, and i fancy theres a bottom to it. there didnt seem to be<br>any where the water went down. first of all, though, doctor, if it was a corn store or granary thered be<br>steps like those that go up, going down. certainly, said the doctor. and from where we stand, so that<br>thepeople could fetch up sacks full or baskets of course. lets see, then, said the american, and<br>opening his box he took out a match, lit it, and going down upon one knee held the burning splint<br>below him. no steps here, he cried, jerking the nearly burned out match out into the gloom. try<br>another, said chris sharply. this was done, and a fresh examination made, but as far as could be seen<br>the great square pit cut out of the rock went down smooth and square without a sign of foothold, i<br>wonder how deep it is, said chris, in a whisper tinged with awe. well soon find that out, said the<br>american, is there a loose stone anywhere about yes, plenty on the terrace outside, said ned, and he<br>stepped back, passed out of the window opening, and returned with a piece of shale as big as his hand.<br>pitch it right out in the middle, squire, cried griggs, and the fragment quitted the boys hand, to fall<br>with a sharp sound upon stone, as near as they could guess some thirty feet below. youre wrong,<br>griggs, said the doctor. am i, sir well, not the first time by many. if this place had been as you think,<br>the bottom would be covered with ashes like those we saw glide down, and that stone would have fallen<br>with a dull thud. very likely, sir. thats only how it seemed to me. shall i go down now, and see no; lets<br>climb up to the next range and see what that tells us we may find same explanation there. mind how,<br>you go, chris; these steps are risky. yes, ill take care, father, panted the boy, who was already<br>canoes can come; for which reason they built here storehouses for all sorts of merchandise, which to<br>and from panama are transported on the backs of mules.here captain morgan was forced to leave his<br>cannoes, and land all his men, though never so weak; but lest the canoes should be surprised, or take<br>up too many men for their defence, he sent them all back to the place where the boats were, except<br>one, which he hid, that it might serve to carry intelligence. many of the spaniards and indians of this<br>village having fled to the near plantations.captain morgan ordered that none hould go out of the<br>village, except companies of one hundred together, fearing lest the enemy should take an advantage<br>upon his men. notwithstanding, one party contravened these orders, being assaulted with great fury by some<br>spaniards and indians, who carried one of them away prisoner. thus the vigilancy and care of captain<br>morgan was not sufficient to prevent every accident, the eighth day in the morning captain morgan<br>sent two hundred men before the body of his army, to discover the way to panama, and any<br>ambuscades therein: the path being so narrow, that only ten or twelve persons could march abreast,<br></P>
