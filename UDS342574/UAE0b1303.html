<P>them, said wilton, who knelt carefully wiping his riflw. i hope so, said bourne, im tired of this<br>murderous work. tis bad, sir, said griggs, from the other side ; but it rests with the redskins. do you<br>think they will give up now, griggs said the doctor. no, sir; i dont, was the reply. oh, griggs, youre<br>making the worst of it, cried chris. no, my lad, imp not. its of no use for me to talk nonsense. i know<br>too much of indian nature. all theyre thinking of now is how to get at us, and have revenge for what<br>we have done. then you think they will attack again sure to sir, replied griggs; but perhaps not with<br>a rush, if they dont,, theyll wait till its dark, and then leave their horses behind and come on with their<br>knives. ugh ejaculated chris. that will be bad for us. harrid, said griggs coolly. it seems hallo theyre<br>coming on again. give em a volley, sir, this time. yes, cried the doctor eagerly, as he saw at a glance<br>that the indians were gathering for another rush. hold your fire, he cried loudly, till they are three<br>parts of the way here, and then all together. ill give the word. but suppose they come on, disamount,<br>and attack afterwards, said chris. you have the second barrels, said the doctor. be ready. here they<br>come. for once more the savages were putting their regular tactics to the test, coming on yelling and<br>waving their weapons, using them to frighten their foew as much as to madden their ponies into a<br>furious gallop, and this right in the rear of another flight of arrows, half of which came from the<br>indians who remained behind for want of room. to the boys this was the most exciting charge of all,<br>devotedly unselfish, when sam scalped her new doll, and fastened the glossy black curls to a wigwam<br>improvised with the curtains of the four post bed in the best bedroom, dot was sorely tried. as her eyes<br>passed from the crown less doll on thefloor to the floss silk ringlets hanging from the bed furniture,<br>her round rosy face grew rounder and rosier, and tears burst from her eyes. hut in a moment more she<br>clenched her little fists, forced  back the tears, and gave went to her favourite saying, i dont care. that<b>sentence was dots bane and antidote; it was her vice and her virtue. it was her standing consolidation,<br>and it brought her into all her scarpes. it was her one panacea for all the ups and downs of her life<br>and in the nursery where sam developed his organ of destructiveness there were ups and downs not a<br>few; and it was the form her naughtiness took when she was naughty. dont care fell into a goose pond,<br>miss dot, said nurse, on one occasion of the kind. i dont care if he did, said miss dot, and as nurse<br>knew no further feature of the goose pond adventure which met this view of it, she closed the subject by<br>putting dot into the corner. in the strength of dont care, and her love for sam, dot bore much and long.<br>her dolls perished by ingenious but untimely deaths her toys were put to purposes for which they were<br>never intended, and suffered accordingly. but sam was penitent and dot was heroic. florindas scalp was<br>mended with a hot knitting needle and a perpetual bonnet, and dot rescued her paint brushes from the<br>glue pot, and smelt her india rubber as it boiled down in sams waterproof manufactory, with long<br>suffering forbearance. there are, however, as we have said, limits to everything an earthquake<br>most perilous situation with the natives, and plainly showing that the imprudence of our countrymen is<br>invariably the cause of quarrels and misunderstandings with these islanders. some days having passed<br>since this altercation with george, we thought no more about it. the brig, from various causes, was<br>certain to remain some time in this harbour; and, as our new zealand guest expressed a great desire to<br>go on shore one day. we consented to his accompanying us. we had scarcely entered our house, when had<br>reason to repent the imprudent step we had taken: all the natives were in commotion; messengers<br>.were sent off to george to acquaint him with the circumstance, and soon after we saw him, attended by<br>all his relations, accountred for war, that is, quite naked, their skins oiled and painted, and armed with<br>muskets. fury was in their looks and gestures as they hastened towards our residence. we had scarcely<br>time to shut and fasten our door, when they made a rush to force it; and we had a severe struggle to<br>keep them out. at one period their rage became so ungovernable that we expected every instant they<br>would fire on us for preventing their entrance. the man who was thecause of all this violence crept into<br>our bedroom, and kept out of sight; but he did not, at any period of the disturbance, exhibit the least<br>sign of fear, so accustomed are they from childhood to these deadly frays. when the natives found we<br></P>
