<P>his hopes, confidently assuring him the white men would not yield him up to his ferociuos foes.<br>notwithstanding all their exertions, he was miserable, till informed by me of his safety; and i received<br>the warmest thanks, and even blessings, from his fair friends, as if i had conferred upon each a<br>personal favour. the man being now in safety, we determined to demand satisfaction for the affront<br>which had been put upon us, and we sent george word we could not again receive him into our house<br>unless he made an ample apology for his behaviour, painting in strong colours how deeply our feelings<br>had been wounded, and how much this indignity had lowered us in the esteem of all our acquaintances.<br>after some consultaion among their leading men upon the subject of our message, king george<br>presented himself at the door of our hut, did the same. thus we gaimed our point, and received both<br>payment and apologies for their violent behaviour. friendship being thus restored, we soon gave them<br>back their muskets, to their infinite surprise and satisfaction. in reflection, i felt quite convinced that<br>the natives liked us the better for what we had done: it afforded them also a lesson of humanity, for<br>they all well knew we had no other object in view when we stood forward to defend the poor fellow, who<br>had relied upon our promise of protecting him. several chiefs told us that they greatly admired our<br>place with the horrors their search had unveiled. it looks from here, said bourne, like the home of so<br>many human bees who had built their peaceful city against the sides of the cliffs. do you think we<br>shall find that similar horrors were perpetrated over yonder if the opposite cells were occupied at the<br>same time im afraid there is no doubt about it. well find out the ascent to those terraces, if we can, to<br>morrow or next day. i wish we could come upon one of the chambers jusr as it was occupied by its<br>owner. i dessay we could find a lot of things here on this side, said griggs quietly to the boys, who<br>generally kept with, him for companion, but it would be an unked fob with shovel and sieve to clear out<br>one of those cells. a what job said chris. unked, my lad. thats what a somersetshire chap i once knew<br>used to call anything dismal and melancholy. this is going to be an unked job this morning, i can tell<br>you, for if it wasnt for the feeling of curiosity to know all about these people i should be ready to<br>pitch it over. well, do, said ned, but wed do it because its learned and wonderful, oh, i think its<br>very fine, props it is, said griggs coolly, but youre not going to take the job out of my hands, and so<br>i tell you, fast hark at him, chris; he has got the idea in his head that hes going to discover swords<br>with golden sheaths, and belts thick with precious stones; helmets. with plumes of feathers, and rich<br>and costly armour, not such a noodle, said ned, whose cheeks had turned very red, for though not so<br>extravagant as the american pointer, he was fain to own to himself that he had some such ideas in<br>him. it sometimes seemed to him as if the painter was using these comments to maje a favourable<br>outcome to the trial a precondition for his help, which of course would make the help itself<br>unnecessary. but despite these doubts forced himself not to interrupt the painter. he did not want to do<br>without the painters help, that was what he had decided, and this help did not want to do<br>without the painters help, that was what he had decided, and this help did not seem in any way less<br>questionable than that of the lawyer. valued the painters help for more highly because it was offered in<br>a way that was more harmless and open. the painter had pulled his seat closer to the bed and<br>continued in a subdued voice: i forgot to ask you; what sort of acquittal is it you want there are three<br>possibilities; absolutele acquittal, apparent acquittal and deferment. absolute acquittal is the best, of<br>course, only there nothing i could do to get that sort of outcome. i dont think theres anyone at all<br>who could do anything i could do to get that sort of outcome. i dont think theres anyone at all<br>who could do anything to get an absolute acquittal. probably the only thing that could actually be possible and you could depend on your<br>innocence along. in that case you wont need me or any other kind of help. at first, was astonished at<br>this orderly explanation, but then, just as quietly as the painter, he said, i think youre contradicting<br>yourself hows that asked the painter patiently, learning back with a smile. this smile made feel as if<br>he were examinig not the words of the painter but seeking out inconsistencies in the procedure of the<br></P>
