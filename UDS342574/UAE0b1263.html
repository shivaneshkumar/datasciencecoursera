<P>condescended to meet them and converse with them for about five minutes; and with that they were<br>satisfied. other heads of departments civil and military behaved differently, and evidently felt a pleasure<br>in having them with them. the commander of the troops suffered them to sit at the same table with<br>himself and officers, and had the war dance performed in the mess room, which i though would have<br>brought the house down upon our heads. he likewise permitted them to fall into the ranks with the<br>soldiers, which pleased them beyond everything, inasmuch as they considered it a higher honour in<br>being permitted to stand by our warriors on the martial parade than to take food with our chiefs at<br>their own table the attonery general of the colony took a particular interest in these savages, and gave<br>a large party, to which they were invited. several of the visitors on this occasion came out of curiosity<br>to see how these cannibals would conduct themselves, expecting no doubt, to witness a display of<br>disgusting gluttony; but in that they were disappointed, for never did any set of men behave with<br>greater decorum than they did on being apprised of this invitation, they were almost anxious to<br>obtain european dresses, and when we refused to lend them ours, they requested of our servants the<br>course of arrow after arrow, some of which flew wide, while others nearly grazed him, but not one hit.<br>the thought that dominated all others now in chriss mind was that he must let go. he had nearly been<br>down twice; then he had stumbled over one of the stones which lay thickly here and there; the ponys<br>hoof grazed his side as, mad with rage and pain, it tore away from him, giving a sudden snatch in its<br>effort to get free from the rein chris had twisted round his hand. for the moment the boy felt that his<br>shoulder was dislocated; then he knew that he had lost his foothold and was being dragged over the<br>ground; and the very next moment, as a terrific yell smote his ears, it seemed to be cut off short and to<br>sound distant, for he was falling through the air, to strike somewhere heavily, roll over and feel that<br>he was gliding down amidst stones and loosened earth. then he was checked again, hanging as it were<br>for a moment before commencing another slide shorter than the last, for he was brought up with a<br>sharp shock against a stone, to which he clung, just as he heard a dull crash somewhere beneath him,<br>and the sound of hoofs learning at stones, which kept on clattering down in an avalanche, to keep up a<br>loud, heavy, rattling noise, but all far below. inspite of the horrible excitement and confusion, chriss<br>brain was clear enough. his left arm felt useless, and his shoulder throbbed, but he was quite conscious<br>that his head was not injured, and perfectly well aware that he had stuck to the rein till the<br>unfortunate pony had dragged him to the edge of the precipice at the head of the valley, and then,<br>mad with pain, gone over, to be lying somewhere below. but not dead yet, for every now and then the<br>this we came here, and arriving at the entry of the lake, we shot off a gun for a pilot from the shore.<br>those on land perceiving we were spaniards, came willingly to us with a pilot, and told us the english<br>had taken maracaibo, and that they were now at the pillage of gibraltar, don alonso, on this news,<br>made a handsome speech to his soldiers and mariners, encouraging them to their duty, and promising<br>to divide among them all they should take from the english; he ordered the guns we had taken out of<br>the ship that was lost to be put into the castle, and mounted for its defence, with two eighteen<br>pounders more, out of his own ship. the pilots conducted us into the port, and don alonso commanded<br>the people on shore to come before him, whom he ordered to repossess the castle, and reinforce it with<br>one hundred men more than it had before its being taken soon after, we heard of year return from<br>gibraltar to maracaibo. whither don alonso wrote you a letter, giving you an account of his arrival<br>and design, and exhorting you to restore what you had taken this you refusing, he ordered<br>them not to take or give any quaarter, which was the occasion of so many being drowned, who dared<br>not to crave quarter, knowing themselves must give none. two days before you came against us, a<br>negro cmae aboard don alonsos ship, with design to burn your fleet. but don alonso not believing this,<br>answered, how can that be have they, peradventure, with enough to build a fire ship or what instruments<br></P>
