<P>safe enough now, squire chris. safe i shouldnt like to risk going near him. but you might; hes held<br>fast by that tail of his, and all he could do would be to thrash you with his long body. and bite, said<br>chris. nay; his biting would go for nothing now. what about his fangs snapped off like points of glass.<br>they were sharp enough and poisonous enough, bat bound to say the poisons all oat on the stone,<br>along with the teeth. razors are very sharp and would make horrible cuts, but not after youd been<br>chopping a piece of stone with them like that, eh, doctor i think you are right, griggs, said the doctor,<br>who seemed fascinated by the reptiles impotent struggles. well, you are a sneak, cri.ed griggs. gahn<br>with you id put my tail between my legs if i were you, only you havent got none. thats right; rattle<br>away i say, i hope he hasnt gone to fetch a lot of his mates to pitch into us. thats not likely, said<br>the doctor, as he watched the bigger and free snake gliding swiftly away, heedless of the struggles of<br>its companion, which was evidently growing exhausted by its furious efforts to release the lower portion<br>of its body, what are you going to do said the doctor quickly, as griggs handed him his horses rein<br>again. im going to put that chap out of his misery, sir, replied the american. no, no; dont fire. its<br>waste of charge not a going to, sir. theres more ways of killing a cat, you know, than hanging it<br>eh, squire chris as he spoke griggs put his hard to his belt, in which a stout keen hunting or bowie<br>knife was stuck, and drew out the glittering blade. going to cut his head off said chris eagerly.yes,<br>of september arrived at the isle an english vessel, which being seen at a great distance by the major,<br>he ordered lesieur simon, who was a frenchman to go and visit the said ship, and tell then that were<br>on board, that the island belonged still to the english. he performed the command, and found in the<br>said ship only fourteen men, one women and her daughter, who were all instantlu ,ade prisoners the<br>english pirates were all transported to puerto velo, expecting three, who by order of the governor were<br>carried to panama, there to work in the castle of st. prom, this fortification is an excellent piece of<br>workmanship, and very strong, being raised in the middle of the port of a quadrangular form, and of<br>very hard stone; its height is eighty eight geometrical feet, the wall being fourteen, and the curtains<br>seventy five feet diamaeter. it was built at the expense of several private persons, the governor of the city<br>furnishing the greatest part of the money so that it cost his majesty nothing, of the island of cuba<br>captain morghan attempts to preserve the isle of st. catherinre as a refuge to the nest of pirates. but <br>fails of his design he arrives at and takes the village of el puerto del principe. captain morgan seeing<br>his predecessor and admiral mansvelt were dead, used all the means that were possible, to keep in<br>possession the isle of st.catherine, seated near cuba. his chief intent was to make it a refuge and<br>sanctuary to the pirates of those parts, patting it in a condition of being a convenient receptacle of<br>their preys and robberies. to this effect he left no stone unmoved, writing to several merchants in<br>virgiania and new england. persuading them to send him provisions and necessaries, towars putting the<br>the care of his brother but he, instead of being faithfu to the trust reposed in him, had actually<br>seduced one of them. this circumstance came to the knowledge of george, and he, feeling for the honour<br>of his absent friend, immediately proceeded to the village, and thus gave the parties warning that he<br>was fully aware of the nature of their proceedings. he had also dispatched a messenger to atoi. to<br>inform him of his disgrace, and to request his immediate return in the course of the day it was<br>expected he would arrive, and bring with him a strong party of friends, all burning with revenge, and<br>eager to punish his brother for his unnatural perfidy. it was thought that unless george interfered,<br>much bloodshed might ensue and it may readily be imagined how anxious we were that this dreaded<br>meeting should be over yet i for one had determined that i would be a witness of it. therefore, when<br>word was brought to me that atoi was crossing the bay, i hastened down to the beach. there i found all<br>parties assembled from both villages. george and his followers. who were to act as mediators, sat<br>immediately in front of the place of landing; behind them were atois  brother and all his partizans; and<br>in the rear were all the women and children, with about a dozen white faces scattered amongst them.<br>the scene was picturesque and exceedingly interesting. it was near the close of a lovely summers day<br></P>
